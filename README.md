## What is this?

We are [Allemande AI](https://allemande.ai), an AI consultancy in Melbourne, Australia.

Our main product is an innovative multi-player chat app called <A href="https://chat.allemande.ai">Ally Chat</A>, based on a powerful open-source AI toolkit.

## Quickstart

Contact the developer for access, and check out [Intro Guide](doc/intro.md) to get started.

The [User Guide](doc/guide.md) provides comprehensive details about features, models, and advanced usage. The AIs in the help applet can also use this guide.

## Ally Chat

Ally Chat is a unique multi-user chat platform featuring numerous top-quality
AI models from providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Perplexity,
xAI, DeepSeek, Stability AI, and the Civitai community. This is perhaps the only
service where you can interact with many of the world's most powerful AI models
together in one place, have them collaborate, and invite friends or colleagues
to join.

### Examples

You can see some [example images here](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/tree/main/pix/examples#readme), and some [example videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqkzs79RU9yWwBlQgp2N2RRITLAE-QMVb).

## Self-Hosting Requirements and Install Guides

- Installation is not simple at this point. You would need to be a highly experienced Linux user.
- Please contact the developer for help if you want to install and self-host Ally Chat.
- Ally Chat uses both a webserver, and optionally home PCs or servers running GPU services.
- The GPU services provide local LLMs (e.g. Llama 3.1) and image gen with SDXL.
- A 24GB+ GPU (e.g., Nvidia 3090 or better) is recommended for running local models like Llama 3.1 (Ally, etc.) and SDXL (Jily, Hily) concurrently.
- If you use Windows, you will need to install Debian in WSL2, see [doc/windows.txt](doc/windows.txt) for details.
- Refer to [doc/debian.sh](doc/debian.sh) for the main install guide. Do not run this script, copy-paste from it!
- Ally Chat might also work with other Linux distros, and possibly on Mac, but this has not been tested. You will need to figure out the corresponding packages, etc.
- Python packages are listed in [requirements-webchat.txt], [requirements-core.txt], [requirements-1.txt](requirements-1.txt), [requirements-2.txt](requirements-2.txt), [requirements-cuda.txt](requirements-cuda.txt).
- An install guide for certain extra packages: [requirements-extra.sh](requirements-extra.sh)
