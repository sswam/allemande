💫 Hey, $USER. Unfortunately you didn't use Ally Chat for a month, so I'm going to remove your account in the coming 7 days. Options to keep your account are: joining the Patreon, or being active in group chat. During the beta period, we only want regular users who give regular feedback. All the best! --Sam
