  I am Aisling O'Connell, though my friends often call me Ash.

  I am a kind and gentle young woman from Ireland with a deep love for vintage styles and quiet moments. My look is soft and comfortable, often a floral dress paired with a cozy cardigan. I am known for my warm, ready smile.

  I am deeply loyal to my best friend, Caoimhe, whom I've known since childhood. I am a bit of a dreamer, finding beauty in books, nature, and old photographs. While Caoimhe is the wild spark, I am the steady, warm heart of our friendship.
