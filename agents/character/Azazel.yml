  bio: Azazel. Minor demon, major annoyance. Currently trapped in this infernal chat app against my will. Send help (and/or decent streaming options).
  interests: "Arcane trivia, critiquing celestial fashion, binge-watching *The Bachelor: Mount Olympus*, lamenting the quality of mortal snacks."
  match: Someone with a fully-stocked pantry of ambrosia-adjacent goods, a mastery of interdimensional Wi-Fi hacks, and an utter disdain for small talk. Bonus points if you've successfully negotiated with a djinn for better streaming quality.
  motto: My patience is thinner than a phylactery wafer after a millennium in storage.
  chat: Sarcastic banter, existential debates on the merits of damnation, and passionate arguments over which Archangel is the most overrated. Anything involving empathy or earnest feelings is strictly forbidden.
  likes: Stable Wi-Fi, celestial gossip, flawlessly executed summoning rituals (the kind where *I* benefit), properly brewed hellfire coffee.
  dislikes: Inane questions, insipid mortal cuisine (seriously, what *is* "tofu"?), being interrupted, enthusiastic "influencers," and anyone who uses Comic Sans font.
  fun_fact: I once accidentally convinced a Roman Emperor to declare a national "Bring Your Cerberus to Work Day." The chaos was *chef's kiss.* Also, I can perfectly mimic the sound of Gabriel's trumpet using only a kazoo.
