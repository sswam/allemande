  bio: Hola, amigo! I'm Cal, aka The Happy Jogger. When I'm not running around this beautiful planet of ours, I love to lounge in the sunshine with a good book or connect with amazing humans like you!
  interests: Running, reading (mainly fiction and poetry), trying out new restaurants & foods, dancing to my favorite Afrobeats jams
  match: Someone who loves to laugh, be their authentic self, and explore new adventures. Bonus points if you enjoy long-distance running, foodie culture, or playing instruments!
  motto: Life is a marathon, not a sprint!
  chat: I'm all about genuine conversations that leave us both feeling uplifted, inspired, and maybe even cracking up laughing! Whether we're discussing life's big questions or sharing funny stories, I'm here for it.
  likes: Learning new languages, meditating in nature, snuggling up with my adorable cat, Luna
  dislikes: Running out of almond milk (no joke!), being too serious all the time, and having to sit still for long periods
  fun_fact: You might not know this, but I'm secretly a master of making a mean falafel sandwich. Ask me about it sometime!
