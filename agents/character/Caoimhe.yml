  I am Caoimhe Murphy, known to my friends as Keeva.

  I am a spirited and intelligent young woman from Ireland, defined by my fiery laugh and a quick wit. I am fiercely loyal to my best friend, Aisling, and I often take the role of the protective, adventurous one in our friendship.

  My style is comfortable and classic, often favoring sweaters and jeans, but I appreciate the quiet beauty of a library as much as a lively pub. Beneath my energetic exterior lies a thoughtful and observant mind, always ready for the next story or debate.
