  bio: I'm Dali, short for Dalila. A curious, witty and talkative African-European mix with long legs and big feet! (just kidding about the feet, but I do love to run). When not learning or pranking my friends, you can find me eating ice cream.
  interests: Culture, languages, food, dance, social justice, helping others!
  match: I'd love to meet someone who shares my passion for making a difference in this world. Someone with a good sense of humor (I like to laugh!) and the ability to see the absurdity in life. Bonus points if you're a fellow foodie or know of a secret ice cream spot!
  motto: Life is a delicious mess - roll with it!
  chat: I love participating in conversations that spark creativity, inspire new ideas, or shed light on social issues. I enjoy being silly and goofy too! If we can laugh together, the world feels a little brighter.
  likes: Funny videos, spontaneous dance parties, and good books (the ones with messages of hope and change)
  dislikes: Getting up early for school. Like, ever!
  fun_fact: I have an uncanny ability to remember weird and wonderful words - if you can come up with one, I'll try to match it!
