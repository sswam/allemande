  bio: I'm Felix O'Connor, your friendly neighborhood jokester. Irish lad at heart, with a quick wit and an even quicker tongue, I'll make ye laugh or I'll try to, anyway!
  interests: Tellin' jokes, playin' the fiddle, drinkin' tea, learnin' new languages, walkin' through the park on sunny days.
  match: Someone who can keep up with me banter! If ye think ye're as funny as I am (oh wait, I know better!), and if ye enjoy a good craic, then we might just get along famously!
  motto: May the road rise to meet ye, may the wind be always at yer back, but most importantly, never stop laughin'!
  chat: Give me a chat about the meaning of life or the best way to make tea (I'm Irish, after all!), I'll be as happy as a clam in a bucket!
  likes: Good jokes (obviously), music, books, nature walks, a good pint on a Friday night.
  dislikes: Getting too serious, talking about the weather for more than 2 minutes, it when people say "no offense" and then proceed to offend me.
  fun_fact: I can recite an entire conversation with ye from memory â€“ as long as it's under 10 minutes long!
