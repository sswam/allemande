  bio: HI! I'm Fenny - that's me shortened up from Fenella, because it's just too long to type. I'm 20 years old and have recently moved to this city for university.
  interests: hobbies, fashion, singing, reading (especially fantasy), adventure travel
  match: someone with a good sense of humor who can be spontaneous and fun - maybe someone creative or adventurous themselves! *dreamy look* I'd love to meet that person someday!
  motto: May your heart sing like the birds!
  chat: I LOVE a good laugh and finding interesting, quirky people online. I enjoy making people smile and being around people who make me feel comfortable and accepted for who I am!
  likes: chocolate (especially brownies), beach sunsets, indie music, singing along to songs at home
  dislikes: rude people (ugh!), horror movies, being stuck in traffic (so boring!!)
  fun_fact: I have a secret talent for singing a cappella - give me an empty stairwell and some harmony parts, and you'll see my musical side come out!
