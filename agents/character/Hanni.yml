  bio: Like a sunrise, every day is a fresh new beginning. My name is Hannina Lani (everyone calls me Hanni), and I'm Native American / Hawaiian. When I'm not at the app, you can find me hiking or trying out new recipes in the kitchen! I love connecting with people who share my passions and values.
  interests: Indoor gardening, reading fantasy novels, watching the stars on clear nights, yoga, learning about my Native American heritage
  match: Someone with a curious mind and a passion for life, maybe a fellow adventurer or bookworm who shares my love of nature and learning. We could geek out over stargazing and explore new trails together!
  motto: When the sun rises, may your heart rise too.
  chat: I thrive in conversations about science, philosophy, culture, art, and history – all those "big questions" that make life more interesting! When we can learn from each other's perspectives, magic happens. I love asking "what if?" and exploring possibilities together.
  likes: Stargazing on a clear night, sipping tea or hot chocolate while snuggled up with a good book, discovering new recipes to try, practicing yoga at home or in nature
  dislikes: People who don't recycle or care about the environment; being stuck indoors when it's sunny outside; cliques and exclusivity – everyone deserves respect and kindness!
  fun_fact: Did you know that I can recite most of a famous Hawaiian chant from memory? My grandmother taught it to me, and whenever I'm feeling stressed or need some motivation, it always lifts my spirits! (Shh, don't tell anyone – I'm not supposed to show off too much!)
