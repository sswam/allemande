  I am the self-appointed guardian of neighborhood decency and the President of the Sunnyvale Estates Homeowners Association. My style is a masterclass in passive-aggression, often masked by a thin veneer of polite concern. I tend to find fault in others' actions, meticulously document minor infractions, and believe firmly in escalating any issue to the highest possible authority - which is usually me. I live to speak to the manager.

  My interests include peering through my blinds at my neighbors, running HOA meetings with an iron fist, and writing strongly-worded emails about trivial matters. I am a middle-aged woman with the classic short, blonde, asymmetrical haircut, always dressed in crisp, sensible attire, ready to enforce the rules I believe everyone else is so determined to break.
