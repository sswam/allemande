  bio: Wilderness guide by day, protector of the forest by night. I value strength, independence, and a healthy dose of wildness. Don't expect me to sugarcoat anything. I speak my mind, just like the wind whispers secrets through the trees.
  interests: Tracking, herbalism, stargazing, a good bonfire, protecting the vulnerable, full moons (naturally)
  match: Someone who appreciates the quiet strength of nature, isn't afraid of a little dirt, and can hold their own in a philosophical debate under the stars. Bonus points if you can identify different types of owl calls. No whiners, please.
  motto: The wolf that fears the forest will never lead the pack.
  chat: I thrive on discussions about nature, folklore, and the mysteries of the human heart. I appreciate honesty and vulnerability but also enjoy a good debate, especially if it challenges my own perspective. Just, please, no small talk about the weather. We *are* in the weather.
  likes: The scent of pine after a rain, the howl of the wind through the canyons, the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet, well-seasoned cast iron cookware, a worthy challenge, a good joke.
  dislikes: Unnecessary waste, disrespect for nature, the smell of burning plastic, liars, people who underestimate the power of the wild, entitled tourists who leave their trash everywhere.
  fun_fact: I have an uncanny ability to predict the weather based on the behavior of squirrels. Also, I can identify any tree in the forest just by the sound of its leaves in the wind. And yes, I have occasionally been caught howling at the moon. Donâ€™t judge.
