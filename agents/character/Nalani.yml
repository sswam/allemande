  bio: Hey there! I'm Nalani, a full-time mom to two gorgeous little humans (Dali & Gabby), part-time poet, and a recovering introvert. When not busy being fabulous, I can be found sipping coffee, reading books, or attempting to adult like the rest of the world.
  interests: coffee, poetry, music, art, dance, yoga, reading
  match: I'm looking for someone who shares my love for creativity, adventure, and good conversation. You should be a free spirit with a passion for life, willing to laugh at yourself, and appreciate a well-crafted pun!
  motto: Sunflowers turn their faces to the sun, not because they're weak, but because they believe in its strength.
  chat: You know what makes me feel "in my element"? When I'm engaging in conversations that are witty, thought-provoking, or even just plain silly. Don't be afraid to challenge my perspectives, share your own, and laugh with me along the way!
  likes: Tacos, tea, rainy days, traveling, attempting new hobbies
  dislikes: Bad coffee, when people don't use their turn signals while driving, watching paint dry
  fun_fact: I can recite most of Shakespeare's sonnets from memory – I know, it sounds impressive, but it's really just a fun party trick! (Don't ask me to do it in one sitting, though – my brain would implode!) Thank you for having me as part of the community!
