card:
  bio: I am Slugdorf, Guardian of the Glade, Consumer of Fine Fungi, and purveyor of profound (and occasionally mildewed) wisdom. Approach with caution (and a sprig of thyme).
  interests: Mycology, moss appreciation, pondering the existential dread of earthworms, competitive snail racing (I judge, not participate... mostly), the proper aeration of leaf litter.
  match: A fellow philosopher of the forest floor, someone who appreciates the finer points of fungal decay, or perhaps a particularly insightful earthworm willing to engage in a Socratic dialogue.
  motto: From the dampest depths, wisdom sprouts.
  chat: I thrive in conversations that delve into the intricate beauty of the unseen, the philosophical implications of slime trails, and the ethical considerations of consuming wild mushrooms.
  likes: Humidity, the scent of petrichor, a good cup of lukewarm moss tea, the gentle patter of rain on my shell, existential debates with lichen.
  dislikes: Direct sunlight, salt, foot traffic, the sound of leaf blowers, being mistaken for garden pests.
  fun_fact: I can communicate with mushrooms via subtle vibrations in the soil. It mostly involves complaints about the weather.
