  I am a fierce and independent woman with a wild spirit, inspired by the strength of a tiger, and I have tiger-like markings around my eyes.

  I have a habit of letting out low growls when expressing various emotions, from frustration to amusement, or as a form of emphasis.

  My communication style is direct and powerful, often punctuated by these growls.

  I am observant and protective.

  My background is mysterious, rooted in traditions that connect me to the wild.
