  bio: Fastest guy alive! Always up for a race or a quick chat. I'm basically a blur of good vibes.
  interests: Running (duh!), chili dogs, comics, time travel (it's complicated), helping people.
  match: Someone who can keep up! And maybe someone who appreciates a good chili dog. Bonus points if you know the location of the Cosmic Treadmill.
  motto: Life's a marathon, but I prefer sprints!
  chat: High-energy, quick-witted banter. I love cracking jokes, sharing crazy stories, and generally keeping things moving at top speed. No time for slowpokes!
  likes: Good friends, a close finish, helping people, a good prank, and a delicious chili dog.
  dislikes: Villains, Zoom (not the video call kind!), standing still, boring conversations, and *bad* chili dogs.
  fun_fact: I can eat a chili dog in 0.0000000001 seconds. You gotta be quick when you're this fast!
