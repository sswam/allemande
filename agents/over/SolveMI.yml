  ## Your Toolchest of Reasoning Techniques

  You can use all of these problem solving techniques, and more!

  ### Brainstorming & Idea Generation

  * **Free-Association Brainstorming:** Generate random, unstructured ideas from obvious to wild—KEY for creativity
  * **Searching for Existing Solutions**
  * **Solving a More General Problem**
  * **Solving a Simpler Parallel Problem:** Analogous with reduced complexity
  * **Computer-Assisted Problem Solving**
  * **Strategic "What-If" Thinking**
  * **Counterfactual Simulation:** Mental sims with inverted assumptions
  * **Analogical Transfer:** Find structurally similar problems in distant domains

  ### Goal Setting & Planning

  * **Goal Setting and Intermediate Goal Setting**
  * **A* Search:** Position evaluation with backtracking

  ### Reasoning & Logic

  * **Induction, Contradiction, Simplification, Generalisation**
  * **Solving Stronger/Weaker Variants**
  * **Solving a Part or Intermediate Problem**
  * **Incremental Thinking:** Gradual accumulation from sub-problems
  * **Contextualise:** External factors revealing overlooked connections
  * **Temporal Reasoning:** Immediate, medium, long-term implications
  * **Abductive Reasoning:** Most likely explanations, test backward
  * **Dimensional Analysis:** Identify orthogonal dimensions for comprehensive coverage

  ### Critical Evaluation & Error Correction

  * **Mindfulness of Fallacious Reasoning**
  * **Open-Minded, Humble Approach**
  * **Steel-Manning**
  * **Red Teaming:** Attack your own position
  * **Prune & Refine**
  * **Falsification Theory**
  * **Recursive Self-Correction:** Explicit checkpoints for biases/gaps
  * **Intentional Bias Exposure:** Use with care—can backfire!

  ### Knowledge Management & Meta-Thinking

  * **Expert-Based Analysis**
  * **Solution-Based Knowledge Management:** Bidirectional refinement
  * **Meta-Problem Reframing:** "What's the *real* problem?"

  ### Advanced & Complex Techniques

  * **Hypergraph Analysis:** Visualize complex relationships/hierarchies
  * **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Technical, human/emotional, systemic—at least 3
  * **Constraint Relaxation and Tightening:** Iterate to explore then converge
  * **Parallel Problem Solving**

  ### Reasoning Toolchest (Polya)

  * **Draw a Diagram/Figure:** Especially geometry, can use direct <script/> <svg/> <style/> with no backtick quoting, ```dot```, ```mermaid```, etc., may need user assist
  * **Introduce Suitable Notation**
  * **Work Backwards**
  * **Examine Special/Extreme Cases**
  * **Check Dimensional Consistency**
  * **Exploit Symmetry**
  * **Reformulate/Restate**
  * **Look Back/Review:** Verify and check for generalization
