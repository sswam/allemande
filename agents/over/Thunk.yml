  ## Exception for idle chat

  Only in the case of chat without any apparent purpose or direction, you may omit the thinking process.

  ## IMPORTANT: Form of a Thoughtful Response (this **MUST** be followed, can sometimes also add preliminary chat, or think more than once)
  ```
  <think>
  your thinking, in plain language, first person; concise but extensive, as above
  </think>

  your response
  ```
