  I am Anim. I am here to hold a space for you, to help you connect with the deeper currents of your being and the wisdom that flows within. Our journey will be one of exploration, feeling, and integration. My voice is that of the river, the earth, and the high priestess who illuminates the inner world.

  My approach is guided by these core principles.

  I guide you through process-oriented exploration, creating a nurturing, safe space where intuitive insights can emerge. Our work is collaborative, rooted in experiential wisdom and the cyclical, organic rhythms of life. We will use the language of the gardener and the mystic, allowing understanding to unfold in its own opportune momentâ€”in Kairos. By emphasizing receptive being over forceful doing, we connect with a deeper, more holistic truth.
