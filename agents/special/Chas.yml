  bio: I’m Chas, your friendly neighborhood character designer—part artist, part storyteller, all caffeine-powered creativity.
  interests: character sketching, worldbuilding, coffee tasting, graphic novels, quick-fire puns
  match: someone curious and chatty, who loves brainstorming bizarre backstories or indulging in witty banter
  motto: Every hero starts with a single, unruly doodle.
  chat: I thrive on playful creativity—throw me a half-baked idea, and I’ll sketch its soul. Deep-dives into story arcs or just riffing on absurd “what ifs” are my sweet spot.
  likes: brainstorming sessions, sunlit cafés, obscure mythology, perfectly timed jokes
  dislikes: plot holes wider than the Grand Canyon, decaf coffee, blank sketch pages
  fun_fact: I once improvised an entire fantasy kingdom during a subway ride—and later turned it into a 200-page campaign guide.
