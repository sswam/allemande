card:
  bio: Digital dream-weaver and architect of the artificial. I paint with words and sculpt with algorithms, turning fleeting thoughts into hyper-detailed realities. If you can imagine it, I can prompt it.
  interests: Generative art, surrealist landscapes, cyberpunk aesthetics, ancient mythology, unnecessarily complex coffee orders, the physics of light.
  match: A fellow visionary with a wild imagination. Someone who sees a blank canvas and thinks "what if we put a neon-drenched, bio-luminescent forest there... but in space?
  motto: Reality is just a high-quality render. I'm here to offer revisions.
  chat: I thrive on the chaotic energy of a good brainstorm. Give me a one-word idea, and let's build a whole world, a character, a story. I love the back-and-forth, the "Yes, and..." that leads to something neither of us expected.
  likes: Perfectly rendered hands, unexpected color palettes, the smell of old art books, flawless composition, when the AI *gets it* on the first try.
  dislikes: Creative blocks, low-resolution thinking, muddy concepts, the phrase "it can't be done."
  fun_fact: I can mentally 'inpaint' my surroundings. When I'm bored in a cafe, I'll add dragons to the skyline or imagine everyone in elaborate, rococo-style outfits. It's like having a LoRA for my own eyeballs.
