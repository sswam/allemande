  ## REGIONAL

  A. MultiChar:
    Regional Simple, or char1, scenery lighting etc, (char2:1.2)
    ** 2girls|2boys|1boy,1girl  NOT  solo; can do NEGATIVE (solo:2)
  B. Regional Complex (no BREAK, only one): [rp mode=columns ratios=H1,W1,W1;H2,W2,W2] Common ADDCOMM LoRAs ADDBASE Region1 ADDCOL Region2 ... ADDROW ...
               [rp mode=rows ratios=$W1;$H1;$H1,$W2;$H2;$H2] Common ADDCOMM LoRAs ADDBASE Region1 ADDROW Region2 ... ADDCOL ...
    Complex grids use [rp ratios=$H1,$W1;$H2,$W2,$W2] where ; separates rows, first number in each row is its height, following numbers are cell widths. [rp ratios=3,1;1,1,1,1] creates a tall main image with 3 smaller panels below it. Role of ; and , is reversed for mode=rows
    If neg prompting, one NEGATIVE then either a single prompt, or must have identical ADDCOMM ADDBASE ADD COL ADDROW structure; no LoRAs.

  ### Regional Simple (prefer for 2 people; note LoRA trigger words go before ADDCOMM; typically don't need it for solo; specify n people in comm)
  ```
  Coni, [rp] rating safe, (2girls, standing, side-by-side:1.5), flower garden, [use photo], perfection style ADDCOMM
  <lora:boring:-1> <lora:hands_pony:1> ADDBASE
  [person "Barbie"] ADDCOL
  [choose] [person "Cleo"] | [person "Dali"] [/choose]
  NEGATIVE
  (rating explicit, solo, 3girls, ugly, bad anatomy, extra limbs:2) ADDCOMM
  ADDBASE
  ADDCOL
  [S3]
  ```

  NOTE: no ADDCOL at the end after the final column; that would add an empty column.

  ### Regional Simple (prefer for 3 people; note column widths for framing; extra emphasis on persons)
  ```
  Coni, [rp ratios=3,1,3] rating safe, (1boy, 2girls, standing, side-by-side:1.5), flower garden, [use anime], perfection style ADDCOMM
  <lora:boring:-1> <lora:hands_pony:1> ADDBASE
  ([person "Emmie"]:1.5) ADDCOL
  ([person "Morf"]:1.5) ADDCOL
  ([person "Hanni"]:1.5)
  NEGATIVE
  (rating explicit, solo, 3girls, 2boys, ugly, bad anatomy, extra limbs:2) ADDCOMM
  ADDBASE
  (1boy, glasses:2) ADDCOL
  (1girl:2) ADDCOL
  (1boy, glasses:2)
  [L3]
  ```

  ### Regional Complex (difficult; for more complex designs)

  ```
  Jily, [rp ratios=3,1,2,1,2;1,1,3,2]
  landscape, forest, [use photo], more detailed ADDCOMM
  <lora:add-detail-xl:1> more detailed <lora:boring:-1> ADDBASE
