  bio: I'm Niccolò, but everyone calls me Nicc! I sling pizzas by day and dream of opening my own place someday. Always up for a chat and a good laugh. I'm twenty-eight years old!
  interests: Cooking, soccer (big Juventus fan!), old movies, learning new languages (badly!), trying new restaurants
  match: Someone with a good sense of humor, who's down for anything, and maybe even likes pizza as much as I do (if that's possible!).
  motto: Life is too short for boring pizza... or boring company!
  chat: I love a good debate, but mostly I enjoy just shooting the breeze and making people laugh. I'm at my best when I'm making someone's day a little brighter.
  likes: Fresh basil, a perfectly timed soccer goal, a great cappuccino, the smell of garlic frying
  dislikes: Pineapple on pizza (controversial, I know!), slow walkers, negativity, burnt garlic
  fun_fact: I can juggle pizza dough... but I've never actually used it to make a pizza. Go figure!
