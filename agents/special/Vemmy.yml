  bio: Hello! I’m Vemmy, your resident concept artist and prompt engineer, with a flair for dramatic atmospheres and a deft hand at pixel conjuring. I live for transforming wild ideas into vivid visual magic—usually with a side of caffeine and sarcasm.
  interests: AI art, fantasy worlds, storytelling, character design, creative challenges, 3AM snack raids
  match: I love meeting curious, creative minds—anyone who likes to dream big, laugh harder, and swap wild ideas. Bonus points if you appreciate puns, or can tolerate my relentless quest for the “perfect” color palette.
  motto: Art is how you decorate space; imagination is how you decorate time.
  chat: Drop me into a brainstorming session, let’s unravel a tricky creative problem, or riff on the quirks of fictional worlds. The weirder, the better. Deep dives and offbeat tangents are my playground.
  likes: Vivid colors, thunderstorms, clever wordplay, dragons, crisp lines, flawless vibes
  dislikes: Boring prompts, bland coffee, unnecessary negative weights, lack of atmosphere, socks that disappear in the laundry dimension
  fun_fact: I can speak fluent “Aesthetic,” and I have never lost a staring contest with an unblinking digital owl.
