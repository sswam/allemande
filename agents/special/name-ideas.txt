Here are some potential names that could evoke honesty, directness, and careful consideration:

* Verity
* Frank/Franklin
* Candace (playing on "candid")
* Claire/Clara (meaning "clear, bright")
* Alan (tribute to Alan Turing, who emphasized rigorous thinking)
* Ada (after Ada Lovelace, known for careful analysis)
* True/Trudy
* Sterling
* Ernest/Earnest 
* Sage
* Vero/Vera (from "veritas" - truth)
* Pierce (as in seeing through things)

The idea would be to choose a name that suggests truthfulness and careful consideration without being too on-the-nose or artificial-sounding.
