In the code you've provided, it's good practice to explicitly call both `response.release()` and `session.close()`. Here's why:

1. `response.release()`: This releases the connection back to the connection pool. It's important to call this when you're done with the response, especially if you're not reading the entire response body.

2. `session.close()`: This closes the entire session, which includes cleaning up any resources associated with it. It's important to close the session when you're completely done with it.

While calling `session.close()` will implicitly close any open connections associated with that session, including releasing responses, it's still considered good practice to explicitly release the response before closing the session. This ensures that resources are freed as soon as possible and can help prevent issues in more complex scenarios.

However, there's a potential issue with your current implementation:

- The `session` and `response` objects are created outside the `get()` function, but they're closed inside it. This means they'll only be closed when the last chunk is read, which might not be ideal if the reader stops early or if there's an error.

A more robust approach might be to use a context manager or to handle the opening and closing of the session and response differently. Here's an example of how you could modify your code:

```python
async def reader_http(source: str, method: str = 'GET') -> Get[bytes]:
    """Returns a get() function for reading from an HTTP/S URL."""
    session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    response = await session.get(source)

    async def get() -> bytes | None:
        try:
            chunk = await response.content.read(8192)
            if not chunk:
                return None
            return chunk
        except Exception:
            raise
        finally:
            if response.content.at_eof():
                await response.release()
                await session.close()

    return get
```

In this version:

1. We only release the response and close the session when we've reached the end of the content.
2. We use a try-except-finally block to ensure that even if an exception occurs, we still attempt to release the response and close the session.

This approach provides better resource management while still maintaining the overall structure of your original function.
