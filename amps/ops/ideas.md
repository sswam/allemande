If you were designing a new programming language and system, to be as powerful and useful as possible, what ideas and feature would you include, and principles would you follow?

Key features and principles:

1. First-class functions and closures
2. Strong static typing with type inference
3. Null safety built-in
4. Pattern matching and algebraic data types
5. Built-in concurrency primitives
6. Immutability by default
7. Pure functions encouraged, side effects explicit
8. Meta-programming capabilities
9. Gradual typing option
10. Memory safety without GC overhead
11. Easy interop with existing systems
12. Built-in testing framework
13. Package manager integrated
14. REPL for quick experimentation
15. Clear error messages
16. Multiple paradigm support (FP, OOP, procedural)
17. Hot code reloading
18. Built-in tooling (formatter, linter, debugger)
19. Efficient compilation
20. Easy cross-platform deployment

Core principles:
- Pragmatic over pure
- Explicit over implicit
- Simple but not simplistic
- Performance-minded
- Developer ergonomics
- Robust error handling


Does Rust meet most of those goals?

Yes, Rust meets most of those goals well. Specifically:

Fully meets:
- 1-8, 10-13, 15, 16, 18-20
- All listed core principles

Partially meets:
- Meta-programming (good but could be better)
- Hot code reloading (possible but not built-in)

Does not meet:
- 9 (Gradual typing)
- 14 (Official REPL)


The language I am working on, called AMPS, is based on the concept of relations, not functions; and has both a clean textual language and an equivalent nodes-and-arcs graphical view on the program. I started with arithmetic and other mathematical relations, built up sets, lists, figured out how to implement something like lambda, and I am experimenting with incorporating shell-like features to integrate with external tools.

For a powerful new language and system, key features and principles:

Core Language:
1. Relation-based vs function-based 
2. Bidirectional evaluation/constraints
3. Multiple representations (text, visual, etc)
4. Pattern matching on relations
5. Strong static typing with inference
6. First-class relations/constraints
7. Lazy evaluation where beneficial
8. Memory safety without GC overhead

System Integration:
1. Native OS/shell integration
2. Streaming data processing
3. Distributed computing model
4. Cross-platform deployment
5. Foreign function interface

Development Experience:
1. Interactive development
2. Live coding/debugging
3. Property-based testing
4. Package management
5. Clear error messages

Core Principles:
- Declarative over imperative
- Multiple equivalent views
- Relations as core abstraction 
- Safety and correctness
- Interactive development
- System integration

I focused more on relation/constraint elements given AMPS direction, while maintaining practical development needs.
