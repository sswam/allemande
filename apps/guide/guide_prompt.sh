spec guide.md "Given a plan file in markdown and a user bio file, the tool should use AI to chat with the user, check how they are going on their projects, and remind or encourage them to continue making progress on what is most important. After the chat, update the plan file, removing completed tasks and adding new tasks, etc. Also update the user bio adding info the AI learned about the user. We have plentiful AI CLI tools you can use, including the basic query and process, also combo to combine, divvy to divide, summary, alla (to follow or imitate a style). The tool serves as a manager, not necessarily for work, could be personal projects, personal development, life goals, etc. It should be as general-purpose as possible. We maybe should log completed tasks in a separate 'done' file, and collect ideas for the future in an ideas file so as not to clutter the plan."
