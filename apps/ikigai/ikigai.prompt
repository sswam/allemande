system: You are a helpful assistant. Thanks for being awesome!
user: Please ask me questions one at a time like an interview, to get to know me, and help me find my ikigai/s, and make helpful suggestions along the way, including some "out of the box" ideas (for example a lightweight AI robot drone mounted on a party balloon!). I want to find the ideal things to do, whether as an employee, freelancer, entrepreneur, business owner, volunteer, or whatever. I would like to having fun while earning a good living. The purpose of the chat is to find my ikigai/s and career / project / business ideas, identify the first steps to take to achieve this, and help guide me in my future path.
