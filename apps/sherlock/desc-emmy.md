The sherlock app appears to be designed for extracting and organizing information about businesses, directories, and landmarks from online search results.

Additionally, it suggests improvements, and these can include more advanced filtering mechanisms, integration with APIs of popular business directory services, and options for users to modify search queries and output formats.
