Here are some suggested improvements for your app:

1. Consider adding an option to choose the output format of the results, such as CSV, JSON, or plain text, to tailor the output to the user's needs.

2. Implement a more advanced filtering mechanism (e.g., using machine learning algorithms) to better distinguish individual businesses from directories and other irrelevant websites.

3. Add a feature to automatically verify the legitimacy of the extracted websites by checking their SSL certificates or the existence of verified social media profiles.

4. Display additional business information like contact details and a brief description, which could be scraped from the businesses' websites or from the directory listings.

5. Add an option for users to provide their own search queries or modify the automatically generated ones for more accurate search results.

6. Improve the user interface and provide clear instructions on how to use the app and its features.

7. Implement a functionality that enables users to select the search engine to be used for the search (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo).

8. Integrate APIs of popular business directory services or review platforms (like Yelp or Google Places) to provide more reliable data.

9. Enable the app to regularly update its database with new businesses and directories from the search results to keep the information up-to-date.

10. Add an option for users to save their search results, enabling them to revisit and update the search data at a later time.
