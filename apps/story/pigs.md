Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As they grew older, their mother decided it was time for them to leave home and build their own houses.

The first little pig, who was rather lazy, decided to build his house quickly out of straw. He gathered some straw and hastily put together a small hut. "Now I can relax," he thought, pleased with his speedy work.

The second little pig, slightly more industrious than the first, chose to build his house out of sticks. He collected branches from the nearby forest and constructed a sturdy-looking cabin. "This will keep me safe," he said confidently.

The third little pig, the most hardworking of the three, decided to build his house out of bricks. It took him much longer than his brothers, but he carefully laid each brick, ensuring his house was strong and secure.

Not long after they had settled into their new homes, a big bad wolf came prowling through the area. He was hungry and looking for an easy meal. He spotted the first little pig's straw house and called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" replied the first little pig.

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down!" roared the wolf. And with one big breath, he blew the straw house away. The first little pig barely escaped and ran to his brother's stick house.

The wolf followed and repeated his threat at the stick house. When the two pigs refused to let him in, he huffed and puffed and blew the stick house down too. The two pigs frantically ran to their brother's brick house.

The wolf, now angrier and hungrier, approached the brick house. He huffed and he puffed with all his might, but the house didn't budge. He tried again and again, but the brick house stood firm.

Frustrated, the wolf decided to try entering through the chimney. The third little pig, being clever, quickly lit a fire in the fireplace. As the wolf slid down the chimney, he fell right into a pot of boiling water. With a yelp, he shot back up the chimney and ran away, never to bother the three little pigs again.

From that day on, the three little pigs lived safely in the brick house, having learned the value of hard work and planning ahead. And they all lived happily ever after.
