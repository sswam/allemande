I'd be happy to write an original story inspired by the classic tale of the three little pigs, while being careful not to reproduce any copyrighted material:

Once upon a time, there were three pig siblings who decided it was time to leave home and build houses of their own. The first pig, who loved to nap, quickly gathered some straw and threw together a cozy hut. The second pig, who enjoyed tinkering, collected sticks and branches to construct a rustic cabin. The third pig, always thinking ahead, took the time to gather bricks and mortar to build a sturdy cottage.

One day, a hungry wolf came prowling through the forest. He spotted the straw house and demanded the pig inside let him in. When the pig refused, the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the flimsy house down! The terrified pig raced to his brother's stick house for safety.

The wolf soon found them and again tried to gain entry. Once more denied, he blew with all his might, sending sticks flying everywhere! The two pigs fled to their sister's brick house.

The wolf arrived, but this time his huffing and puffing had no effect on the solid brick walls. Frustrated, he tried to climb down the chimney, but the clever pigs had prepared a pot of hot soup at the bottom! The scorched wolf ran away howling, never to bother the three little pigs again.

From that day on, the siblings lived together happily in the brick house, having learned valuable lessons about planning, hard work, and looking out for each other.
