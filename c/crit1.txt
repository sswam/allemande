1. The `get_cflags` function uses a static buffer `cflags`. This is not
thread-safe and can lead to issues if `ccx` is used in a multithreaded
environment. It should be changed to either allocate the buffer dynamically
or require the caller to provide the buffer.
2. In `get_cflags`, the code copies the contents of the line directly into
`cflags` without checking if the length of the `start` exceeds the size
of the `cflags` buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow. Use `strncpy`
instead of `strcpy`.
3. In `main`, the allocation size for `new_argv` is incorrect. It should be
`sizeof(char*) * (argc - 1)` since the first argument is the ccx program
itself, and the second argument is the source file which isn't passed to the
compiled program. Or `sizeof(char*) * (argc -1 )`.  The code skips argv[1]
which is good, but incorrectly computes allocation size.
4. In `main`, the loop assigning values to `new_argv` starts from `i =
2`. This means `new_argv[0]` is never initialized, and the following
assignment `new_argv[i-1] = argv[i]` assigns `argv[2]` to `new_argv[1]`,
`argv[3]` to `new_argv[2]`, and so on. `new_argv[0]` which should be the
name of the executed program `out` is missed.  Also the malloc size does not
correspond to the assignments.
5. In `main`, the `free(new_argv)` call is reached only if `execv` fails. If
`execv` succeeds, the allocated memory is never freed, leading to a memory
leak. It might be better to `fork()` then `execv` in the child, and have the
parent cleanup.
6. The use of `system(cmd)` is generally discouraged due to security risks
(e.g., command injection).  Consider using `fork()` and `exec()` directly for
better control and security.
7. The code does not handle errors from `strcat` or `snprintf` which can lead
to buffer overflows if the combined string exceeds the size of the `out` or
`cmd` buffers, respectively.
8. The `sea.o` object is hardcoded. This is inflexible.
