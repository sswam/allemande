1.  **`c/ccx.c`:** The `get_cflags` function uses a static buffer for
`cflags` that is not reset on each call. If a file without a `//!CFLAGS:`
line is processed after one that has one, the flags from the first file will
be incorrectly reused.
2.  **`c/ccx.c`:** There is a severe command injection vulnerability. CFLAGS
are read from the source file and formatted directly into the command string
executed by `system()`. A malicious C source file could execute arbitrary
shell commands.
3.  **`c/ccx.c`:** The repeated use of `strcat` to build the output
filename is unsafe and could cause a buffer overflow if the source path is
long. `snprintf` should be used for safety.
