1. uniq=False is not honored for multiple occurrences of the same name:
who_is_named only returns one match per agent. test_uniq_flag expecting three
"alice" entries will fail.

2. find_name_in_content computes absolute position with
content.find(sentence), which can be wrong if the same sentence text appears
multiple times. Track offsets while splitting instead.
