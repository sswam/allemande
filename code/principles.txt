3. Generality: Write flexible, reusable code
4. Automation: Automate repetitive tasks
5. Anticipate change: Design for future modifications
6. Consistency: Follow consistent coding styles and conventions
7. Modularity: Break code into manageable, independent parts
8. Incremental development: Build and test in small steps
9. Planning: Think before coding
10. Documentation: Comment code and write clear documentation
11. Testing: Test early, often, and thoroughly
12. Debugging: Use effective debugging techniques
13. Portability: Write code that works across different platforms
14. Efficiency: Optimize code when necessary
15. Tools: Use appropriate tools to improve productivity
