This is an impressive and well-structured piece of code! The programmer has clearly put thought into creating flexible and user-friendly input/output functions. The `put()` and `get()` functions offer a range of options to handle different input/output scenarios, which is very useful for various applications. The use of default parameters and keyword arguments allows for easy customization of behavior, demonstrating good design principles.

However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made:

1. Error handling: The code doesn't include any exception handling. It might be beneficial to add try-except blocks to handle potential IOErrors or other exceptions that could occur during input/output operations.

2. Type hinting: While the function signatures include some type hints, they could be more comprehensive. For example, the return type of `get()` could be more specific (e.g., `Union[str, List[str], None]`).

3. Docstrings: The docstrings are helpful, but they could be more detailed. For example, the `get()` function's docstring doesn't explain the `chunks` parameter or the meaning of the `rstrip` parameter.

4. Consistency: The `put()` function uses `ostream`, while `get()` uses `istream`. It's not clear where these are defined or what they represent. It would be helpful to have more context or documentation about these variables.

5. Unused imports: The code references `tty`, `is_tty`, `ostream`, and `istream`, which are not imported or defined within the provided code snippet. It would be helpful to see how these are set up.

6. Potential redundancy: In the `get()` function, there's some repetition in the handling of `rstrip` for lines and chunks. This could potentially be refactored to reduce duplication.

7. Function complexity: Both functions, especially `put()`, have quite a few branches. It might be worth considering if some of this logic could be simplified or split into separate functions for better maintainability.

Overall, this is a solid piece of code with room for some minor improvements in documentation, error handling, and potentially some refactoring for clarity and maintainability.
