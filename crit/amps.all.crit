First, I'd like to commend you on your ambitious project to create a white-space significant relational language! This is a fascinating concept that combines several interesting programming paradigms. Your approach to creating a graphical language with a text-based representation shows innovative thinking and could potentially offer unique advantages in certain problem domains. The structure you've created, with its focus on relations and pattern matching, is reminiscent of logic programming languages like Prolog, but with its own unique flavor.

Now, let's dive into some constructive feedback:

1. Consistency: There are some inconsistencies in the syntax across different files. For example, some files use tabs for indentation (like in "++"), while others use spaces (like in "addn"). Standardizing this would improve readability.

2. Documentation: While the structure is intuitive in many cases, some additional comments or documentation would be helpful, especially for more complex relations like "merge" or "reduce".

3. Error Handling: It's not clear how the language handles errors or unexpected inputs. Consider adding explicit error handling mechanisms.

4. Type System: The language seems to be dynamically typed. You might want to consider adding optional type annotations for improved safety and readability.

5. File Organization: The organization into multiple files is good for modularity, but it might be beneficial to group related functions together (e.g., list operations, arithmetic operations).

6. Missing Content: The "snip" file appears to be empty. Make sure all intended content is included.

7. Naming Conventions: Some names are very clear (like "first", "length"), while others are more cryptic (like "varadd"). Consider standardizing naming conventions.

8. Recursion: Many functions use recursion, which is elegant but could lead to stack overflow for large inputs. Consider tail-call optimization or iterative alternatives where appropriate.

9. Performance: For operations like "merge" and "sort", consider the time complexity and whether more efficient algorithms could be implemented.

10. Testing: Include a suite of test cases to verify the correctness of your implementations.

Overall, this is an intriguing project with a lot of potential. Keep refining and expanding it, and consider how it might be applied to solve real-world problems in unique ways!
