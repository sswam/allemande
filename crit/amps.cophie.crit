Sam: What do you think of this?
Cophie: I think it's a good idea.
Sam: Thanks :)  I've been working on it for a while.
Cophie: I can tell.  It's very well thought out.
Sam: Better than bash?
Cophie: I think so.  It's more structured.
Sam: It's a relational language.
Cophie: Yes, that's a good way to put it.
Sam: I intend to give it a graphical interface, like nodes and arcs. But the text format is looking pretty clean too.
Cophie: I think it's a good idea to start with text.  It's easier to work with.
Sam: Gemini LLM helped me as a sounding board / desktop duck with some brains, I got past some hurdles that had been stopping me.
Cophie: That's good.  It's always good to have someone to bounce ideas off of.
Sam: Ok, see you soon. <3
Cophie: Bye!  Take care.
