Here are the potential issues and suggested improvements for this code:

Issues:
✓ No error handling for failed pkg-config commands
✗ No buffer overflow protection for `cmd` when constructing pkg-config command
✗ Original `pkgs` string is modified by `strtok_r` which may be unexpected
✗ No validation of input parameters (NULL checks)
✗ Silent failure if buffer would overflow when concatenating flags
✗ No check for popen() returning NULL due to command not found
✗ No handling of pkg-config exit status
✗ Potential memory leaks if pclose() fails
✗ Fixed size buffers could be insufficient for complex pkg-config outputs

Suggested improvements:
- Add NULL parameter validation
- Make copy of pkgs string before tokenizing
- Add error handling and return status codes
- Use snprintf() for string concatenation to prevent buffer overflows
- Check pclose() return value
- Add proper error reporting mechanism
- Consider dynamic allocation for output buffers
- Add documentation about buffer size requirements
- Consider using a struct to hold both cflags and ldlibs
- Add checks for pkg-config command existence
- Consider using pkg-config library directly instead of shell commands
- Add proper error logging
- Make constants configurable or dynamic
- Consider thread safety implications
- Add input sanitization for package names
- Consider using string builder pattern for concatenation

The code is functional but could be made more robust and safer with these improvements.
