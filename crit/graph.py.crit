Thank you for sharing this code! It looks like you've created an impressive graph editor program with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter. The program allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize graphs interactively. This is a cool and useful application that could be valuable for various purposes like network visualization or diagramming. I appreciate the effort you've put into creating such a feature-rich tool.

Now, let me provide some constructive feedback and suggestions:

1. Error handling: Consider adding more robust error handling throughout the code. For example, when reading files or performing operations on nodes/arcs, try-except blocks could help catch and handle potential exceptions gracefully.

2. Code organization: The code could benefit from being split into multiple files for better organization. For instance, you could separate the Node, Arc, and various Controller classes into their own modules.

3. Type hinting: While you've used type hinting in some places (e.g., `node_by_id: dict[int, 'Node']`), expanding its use throughout the code would improve readability and maintainability.

4. Comments and docstrings: Adding more comments and docstrings to explain complex parts of the code and the purpose of each class and method would make the code more accessible to other developers.

5. Constants: Consider using constants for values like default node radius, colors, or canvas dimensions. This would make it easier to modify these values in the future.

6. PEP 8 compliance: Some parts of the code deviate from PEP 8 style guidelines. For example, there are some lines longer than 79 characters, and some variable names use camelCase instead of snake_case.

7. Command pattern: The command system is a good start, but you might consider implementing a full Command pattern for better extensibility and undo/redo functionality.

8. Testing: Adding unit tests for the various components would help ensure the reliability of the code and make it easier to refactor in the future.

Overall, this is an impressive project with a lot of functionality. These suggestions are meant to help improve its maintainability and extensibility as the project grows. Great work on creating such a useful tool!
