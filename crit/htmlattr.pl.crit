1. The regex pattern in htmlattr.pl `/ $attr=(.*?)[ >]/` can match beyond the
intended attribute value if there's no space or > character immediately after
it. It should be made more strict to avoid potential parsing errors.

2. The htmlattr.pl script doesn't handle HTML attributes without values
(boolean attributes), which could be considered a limitation.

3. The script doesn't properly handle attributes containing spaces that
aren't properly quoted, which could lead to incorrect parsing in some cases.
