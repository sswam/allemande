I've reviewed the code, and overall, it's well-structured and documented. Here's a critique with some suggestions for improvement:

Strengths:
1. Good documentation: The module, function, and CLI usage are well-documented.
2. Use of type hints: This improves code readability and helps with static type checking.
3. Flexible input handling: The code can handle both file input and string input.
4. Use of regular expressions: Appropriate for parsing Markdown code blocks.
5. CLI interface: The use of argh makes the command-line interface user-friendly.

Areas for Improvement:

1. Error Handling:
   - Add try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions, especially when reading from stdin or parsing input.

2. Code Duplication:
   - The logic for commenting non-code sections is repeated. Consider extracting this into a separate function.

3. Complexity:
   - The main function `extract_code_from_markdown` is quite long and handles multiple responsibilities. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions.

4. Naming:
   - The variable `istream` might be confusing. Consider renaming it to `input_source` or something more descriptive.

5. Type Hinting:
   - Add more type hints, especially for function return types.

6. Constants:
   - Define constants for repeated values like the code block pattern.

7. Testing:
   - Add unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected across different scenarios.

8. Performance:
   - For large files, consider using a streaming approach instead of reading the entire file into memory.

9. Code Style:
   - Consider using a linter like flake8 to ensure consistent code style.

10. Dependency Management:
    - Include a requirements.txt file or use a tool like Poetry for better dependency management.

11. Shebang Handling:
    - The shebang handling logic could be extracted into a separate function for better readability.

Here's a small example of how you might refactor part of the code:

```python
def comment_text(text: str, comment_prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [f"{comment_prefix} {line}" for line in text.split('\n')]

def handle_shebang(code: str) -> Tuple[str, Optional[str]]:
    code_lines = code.split('\n')
    shebang_line = None
    for i, line in enumerate(code_lines[:3]):
        if line.startswith('#!'):
            shebang_line = line
            code_lines.pop(i)
            break
    return '\n'.join(code_lines), shebang_line

# In the main function:
if non_code and comment_prefix is not None:
    output.extend(comment_text(non_code, comment_prefix))
    output.append('')

if select is None or count in select:
    if shebang_fix and count == 0:
        code, shebang_line = handle_shebang(code)
    output.append(code)
    output.append('')
```

These changes would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
