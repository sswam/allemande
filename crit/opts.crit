This is a well-structured and feature-rich option parser for Bash scripts. Here's a review and critique of the code:

Strengths:
1. No dependencies: The script is self-contained and doesn't rely on external tools.
2. Flexible: Supports various option types (flags, string values, arrays, and associative arrays).
3. Auto-generated usage: The usage function reads the script itself to generate help text.
4. Error handling: Provides informative error messages for unknown options and invalid inputs.
5. Naming convention: Converts option names with dashes to underscores for variable names.
6. Type checking: Attempts to determine the type of the option based on how it's declared.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Associative array support: The `opts_set_assoc` function is incomplete and doesn't work yet.
2. Function support: There's a check for functions, but no implementation for setting them.
3. Complex option parsing: The parsing of array and associative array options could be more robust.
4. Error handling for undeclared variables: The script assumes variables are pre-declared, which might not always be the case.
	- response: the desired use is for the parent script to pre-declare vars to receive options, with their default values
5. IFS handling: The IFS is changed in some functions but not consistently restored.
	- response: I think the IFS handling is okay, but please double-check and fix if needed
6. Bash version compatibility: Some features might not work in older Bash versions.
	- response: that's okay, I don't care about very old versions

Suggestions:
1. Complete the associative array support in `opts_set_assoc`.
2. Implement the function for setting function options if that's a desired feature.
3. Add more robust error checking and handling throughout the script.
	- response: Please do this only if really necessary, I don't want to bloat it out.
4. Consider adding support for long options (e.g., --debug instead of just -debug).
	- response: It already works with both forms. Note: When setting a value, it requires like -foo=value not -foo value.
5. Add comments explaining the more complex parts of the code.
6. Consider adding a way to specify required options and validate them.
	- response: I don't think so, required option seems like an oxymoron, I'll just use defaults or the parent script can check and raise an error if something isn't set that it requires.
7. Implement a way to handle options with optional arguments.
	- response: At the moment -foo sets foo=1 and -foo=2 sets foo=2. It works well I think.

Overall, this is a solid and useful option parser for Bash scripts. With some refinements and additional features, it could become an even more powerful tool for script authors.
