Thank you for sharing your shell options handler script! It's clear that you've put a lot of thought and effort into creating a flexible and user-friendly option parsing system for Bash scripts. Your approach to handling different types of options (switches, scalars, and arrays) is clever and comprehensive. The usage function that automatically generates help text from the script itself is particularly impressive and useful.

Here are some observations and suggestions for potential improvements:

1. Error Handling: The script does a good job of catching and reporting various errors. However, you might consider adding more specific error messages for different scenarios to help users debug their scripts more easily.

2. Consistency: The script uses both `$[ ]` and `$(( ))` for arithmetic operations. It's generally recommended to stick to one style for consistency. The `$(( ))` syntax is more modern and widely used.

3. Portability: While the script is designed for Bash, some constructs (like `declare -p`) might not work in all POSIX-compliant shells. If portability is a concern, you might want to add a check for Bash at the beginning of the script.

4. Documentation: The inline comments are helpful, but you might consider adding more extensive documentation, perhaps in a separate README file, explaining all the features and giving more examples of usage.

5. Testing: It would be beneficial to include a set of test cases to ensure the script behaves correctly under various scenarios.

6. Performance: For very large scripts with many options, the current method of reading the entire script for usage might be slow. You could consider an alternative approach for such cases.

7. Long Options: While the script handles long options with double dashes, it treats them the same as short options. You might consider adding specific support for GNU-style long options (e.g., `--long-option=value`).

8. Dependency: The script uses `tsv2txt` in the usage function, which might not be available on all systems. Consider providing a fallback or making this optional.

Overall, this is a well-crafted and useful script that could indeed be valuable if ported to other languages for consistency across different environments. Great work on creating a clean and functional option parsing system!
