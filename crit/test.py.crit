Thank you for sharing your code! It's great to see you're working with advanced language models like Llama 3 8B. Your script demonstrates a good understanding of using transformers for text generation, and I appreciate your efforts to create a flexible command-line interface for interacting with the model. The use of environment variables to control TensorFlow and PyTorch usage shows thoughtful consideration of the runtime environment.

Now, let's address the issue you're experiencing and suggest some improvements:

1. Hanging issue: The main problem seems to be that the pipeline is not generating output. This could be due to the model not finishing its generation process. Try adding a max_length parameter to limit the output size:

```python
result = pipeline(prompt, max_length=100)  # Adjust the value as needed
```

2. Error handling: Add try-except blocks to catch and log any exceptions that might occur during model loading or text generation.

3. Model loading feedback: Add a print statement or log message to indicate when the model has finished loading, so you know it's ready for input.

4. Generation parameters: Consider adding more parameters to control the generation process, such as temperature, top_k, or top_p.

5. Streaming output: For long generations, you might want to implement streaming output to see results as they're generated.

6. Input validation: Add checks to ensure the input prompt is not empty or too long.

7. Memory management: If memory is an issue, you could try loading the model in 8-bit quantization:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model, device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = transformers.pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

8. Consider using the newer `TextGenerationPipeline` class for more control:

```python
from transformers import TextGenerationPipeline, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model, device_map="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)
pipeline = TextGenerationPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

These suggestions should help improve the functionality and reliability of your script. Keep up the great work!
