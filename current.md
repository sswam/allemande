# Current Directions

I need to prioritise and figure out what to work on next

## Chat App

This is the main app with SaaS prospects. Next thing to do is to improve the code quality and modularity. Then improve the auth, and allow new users to sign up. Then add accounting, and payment / subscriptions. After that boring stuff I can work on adding image generation, roles, files, etc.

## Story App

Next thing to do is to build a user interface for it. 

## Marketing

Enable users to try the chat and the apps before they sign up. How to control this? maybe just block abusive IPs or even ranges from the free access?

## LLM coding tools

Keep working on these as needed. Refactor tool is needed. I want to make another pass over my IO system, get it as good as possible, then change everything to use it.

## AMPS

AMPS has great potential and would be a really significant contribution. I should continue working on it at least once a week. It can potentially make my life a lot easier compared to working with Shell and Python scripts. The next step was to experiment with AMPS programs built from UNIX tools.
