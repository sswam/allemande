Thank you for sharing this interesting code! It appears to be a thoughtful implementation of a source code transformer, likely converting a custom syntax into C/C++. The code shows good organization and careful handling of different syntactic cases. I particularly appreciate the attention to detail in handling edge cases like templates and extern "C" declarations.

Here are some potential issues and suggestions:

Issues:
1. The MAXTABS constant (256) is arbitrary and could be exceeded - consider making this dynamic
2. Several global variables (l, len, tabs, etc.) make the code harder to maintain and thread-unsafe
3. Missing error handling in some string operations that could buffer overflow
4. The comment "XXX do lastlabel and lastcase work?" suggests potential bugs that should be investigated
5. Some functions like `classy()` could use more robust parsing

Suggestions for improvement:

Standard Compliance:
- Add proper header guards
- Add const qualifiers where appropriate
- Consider using size_t instead of int for sizes
- Add error handling for string operations

Structural Improvements:
- Consider creating a proper context struct instead of global variables
- Split into smaller functions following the guidance about avoiding deep nesting
- Add input validation for array bounds
- Consider using enums with explicit values

Creative "out of the box" ideas:
1. Consider implementing a reverse transformation (C back to the custom syntax)
2. Add source map generation for debugging
3. Consider adding a validation pass before transformation
4. Implement an interactive mode showing side-by-side preview
5. Add support for custom transformation rules via configuration file
6. Consider implementing syntax highlighting for the custom syntax

The code generally follows the provided standards well, but could benefit from more consistent error handling and reduced global state.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
