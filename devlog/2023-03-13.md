## Devlog: Week of 2023-03-13 to 2023-03-19

This week was focused on releasing a method to reconstruct the fine-tuned weights of the Stanford Alpaca model. It involved a bit of crypto trickery to get around licensing restrictions, so most of the work revolved around that.

*   **Initial Commit and Setup:** The week kicked off with the initial commit and project setup. This included creating the basic directory structure, adding initial files, and setting up the `.gitignore`. The project was named `point-alpaca` and the aim was to release weights.

*   **Weight Distillation via XOR Encryption:** Since directly distributing the fine-tuned LLaMA weights isn't permissible, a method of XOR encryption was implemented. This allows users who legally obtained the original LLaMA weights to apply the provided "patch" and recreate the fine-tuned Alpaca weights.  The core logic for encryption and decryption was implemented in `encrypt.py` and `decrypt.py`, respectively.  The encrypted files are hosted remotely and listed in `filelist.txt`.  A specific checksum mechanism was added to `encrypt.py` and used by `decrypt.py` to ensure the integrity of the decrypted files. There was a bug in the script relating to the file extensions after decryption which was quickly fixed.

*   **Infrastructure and Automation:**  The `filelist.txt` file was updated to include all necessary encrypted files.  The README was updated to explain the process, including downloading the encrypted diffs using `wget` (initially, `curl` was used) and decrypting them.

*   **Inference Code:** Initial inference code was added in `chat.py` to allow users to interact with the reconstructed model.  This involved loading the model and tokenizer, implementing a simple chat loop, and generating responses. The directory that the inference pointed to was updated so it points to the right directory. The inference code was updated to remove irrelevant lines.

*   **Documentation and Refinement:**  The README was updated with instructions, explanations, and a link to the Telegram chat.  The Alpaca logo was added to the README to visually represent the project.

*   **Windows Compatibility:** A command to decrypt files on Windows was added.

Overall, it was a productive week focused on circumventing artificial barriers to open-source AI development. We don't care to blindly obey rules that serve no practical purpose!
