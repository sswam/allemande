## Devlog: Week of 2023-03-20 to 2023-03-26

This week saw a continued focus on the Alpaca weight reconstruction project, alongside some initial exploration of a new assistant script.

*   **Performance Improvement: Multi-Core Decryption:** A significant improvement was made to the `decrypt.py` script by adding multi-core support using multiprocessing. This leverages multiple CPU cores to drastically speed up the decryption process.

*   **Improved Documentation and Hardware Requirements:** The README was updated with checksums for the encrypted files, original LLaMA weights, and the resulting decrypted files. This helps users verify the integrity of their downloads and reconstructions. Also hardware requirements were added. Some clarifications were added about quantization. Added VRAM size of 3060.

*   **Experimental Assistant Script:** I forked the point-alpaca repo, and started working on an assistant script written in Python (`assistant.py`). This script aims to provide a more interactive and configurable interface for interacting with language models. The initial version includes features like:

    *   Model loading and caching to avoid reloading the same model repeatedly.
    *   Token counting to manage context length and prevent exceeding memory limits.
    *   Generation with configurable parameters (temperature, top\_k, top\_p, etc.)
    *   Basic conversation history management with token-aware trimming.
    *   Command-line argument parsing for customization.
    *   Configuration via YAML files.

    The script also includes example configurations for experiments and different models.  Some example scripts were created to run the script such as `eg/watch` and `eg/free-form`.

    There was some tweaking with memory management, to ensure the system does not drop too much of the history.

    Finally the `assistant` script was renamed to `assistant.py` to enable its potential use as a module or for testing with `pytest`.

*   **Miscellaneous Fixes and Tweaks:** Several minor fixes and tweaks were made throughout the week, including:
    * Updates to example scripts.
    * Configuration adjustments.
    * Code improvements.
    * Fixing some minor bugs.
