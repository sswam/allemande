## Devlog: Week of 2023-03-27 to 2023-04-02

This week was a whirlwind of activity, focusing on integrating voice interaction, enhancing the GPT tooling, and preparing for a demo. A significant amount of time was spent on refining scripts for voice interaction and video processing, with a strong emphasis on usability and practical application.

*   **Voice Interaction Implementation:** The major highlight of the week was getting voice interaction working.  Two scripts were created, `bb-voice-1.sh` and `bb-voice-2.sh`, to facilitate voice chat. `bb-voice-2.sh` leverages `mike.py` for speech-to-text and a `speak` script (later replaced with `speak.py`) for text-to-speech, creating a basic voice chat pipeline. Significant adjustments were made to the voice tone and speaking style, with variations introduced in `bb-voice-2.sh` to allow resuming from existing files.  There was effort put into addressing some issues found while demonstrating the voice chat functionality.

*   **GPT Scripting Enhancements:** The GPT tooling received a substantial overhaul. Several new helper scripts were added, including `gpt-code`, `gpt-debug`, `gpt-dotpoints`, `gpt-flashcards`, `gpt-insanify`, `gpt-loop`, `gpt-pp`, `gpt-split`, `gpt-summary`, `gpt-todo`, `gpt-topic`, and `gpt-tutorial`. These scripts provide specialized prompts for various tasks like code improvement, debugging, summarization, and generating flashcards. A new `ocr` script was introduced to perform OCR using Tesseract and GPT for error correction. Crucially, `gpt_process` was deprecated and replaced with direct calls to a more robust `gpt` module. `gpt.py` was heavily modified with a much more sophisticated interface, and the helper scripts now call `gpt process` rather than `gpt_process`.

*   **Video Processing Pipeline:** A simple pipeline was created, leveraging `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` to allow generation of flashcards from video.

*   **Code Cleanup and Refactoring:** The `assistant` script was renamed to `barbarella.py`. The old `speak.sh` script was replaced with a more flexible `speak.py`, enabling more control over voice synthesis.  Python code was pylinted and improved significantly.

*   **Model Upgrades:** The system was upgraded to utilize `whisper-large` for improved transcription accuracy and `GPT4` for better response quality.

*   **Infrastructure:** Several quality-of-life changes were made, including creating symlinks for commonly used scripts. A `.gitignore` entry was added to ignore generated files under the `video` directory.

*   **Documentation:** The README was updated with a video link/thumbnail.

This was a very productive week, laying the groundwork for more advanced AI-powered interactions and content generation. The integration of voice and video processing, combined with the refined GPT tooling, positions the project for exciting future development.
