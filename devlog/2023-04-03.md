## Devlog: Week of 2023-04-03 to 2023-04-09

This week focused on expanding text processing capabilities, improving voice chat integration, incorporating image analysis tools, and enhancing the ChatGPT model switching script. The goal is to enable a more versatile and user-friendly AI chat experience.

*   **Text Tool Suite Expansion:** A significant effort was made to import and develop a suite of command-line text processing tools. These tools, located in the `text/` directory, aim to provide utilities for manipulating text in various ways, which will help greatly in pre-processing data for the LLMs and post-processing their outputs. Created were scripts such as:

    *   `adjust-blank-lines`: Corrects blank lines and indentation.
    *   `brace.py`: Converts Python-style indentation to C-style braces.
    *   `catpg.sh` and `cat-sections.py`: Concatenates files with paragraph breaks and optional section headers.
    *   `html2selectors.py`: Converts HTML to CSS selectors, useful for web scraping and content extraction.
    *   `pgtac.py`: Reverses the order of paragraphs in a text.
    *   `recs2tsv.pl`: Converts records to TSV format.
    *   `shell-template.sh`: Executes shell scripts that use environment variables as templates.
    *   `single-blank-lines.pl`: Ensures only single blank lines exist between paragraphs.
    *   `split-file.py`: Splits a large file into smaller files based on a delimiter.
    *   `split-long-sentences-ai.py`: Attempts to split very long sentences into smaller, more manageable units using an LLM to do the splitting.
    *   `split-sentences.py`: Splits a text into sentences using spaCy.
    *   `squeeze-blank-lines.pl`: Removes multiple consecutive blank lines.
    *   `strip-lines.py`: Removes leading/trailing whitespace from each line.
    *   `tab.py`: Converts spaces to tabs for indentation.
    *   `tail-f.py`: Acts like `tail -f` but correctly handles shrinking files, necessary for some logging scenarios.
    *   `tsv2markdown.py`: Converts TSV data to Markdown tables.
    *   `words-join.py` and `words-split.py`:  Losslessly splits text into words and rejoins them, useful for diffing/patching workflows.

*   **Voice Chat Enhancements:** Continued work on voice chat, involving multiple components:

    *   The `bbv` script, which launches all voice chat components was revived after being moved.
    *   The core of the voice system involves several scripts, typically running in separate xterm windows:  `bbv-1-brain.sh` (runs `barbarella.py`, the LLM), `bbv-2-mike.sh` (uses `mike.py` to transcribe speech-to-text), and `bbv-3-speak.sh` (uses `speak.py` for text-to-speech).  These scripts are configured by `env.sh`.
    *   `tail-f.py` was integrated into `bbv-3-speak.sh` to correctly handle log file updates.
    *   Tweaks were made to `speak.py`, and voice tone, through modifications to the `env.sh` script.
    *   A `toggle-mic.sh` script was created to toggle the microphone state via `amixer`, providing a quick mute/unmute functionality.

*   **Image Analysis Integration:**  The project now incorporates tools for image analysis:

    *   `vision/amg` is a script for generating masks for images, using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).
    *   `vision/image-apply-masks.py` applies these masks to images to isolate specific regions.
    *   `vision/image2text.py`, based on the "clip-interrogator", generates textual descriptions of images using CLIP.

*   **ChatGPT Model Switcher User Script:** A user script was created for switching the ChatGPT model mid-chat.  This script adds a selector to the ChatGPT interface and intercepts API calls to modify the model parameter. Refactoring involved creating functions, defining constants, and improving the message display when switching models.
    *   The main code for this lives in `chatgpt-model-switcher/chatgpt-model-switcher.user.js`.
    *   There's also a manifest file and icons, suggesting it can be packaged as a Chrome extension if desired.

*   **General Improvements and Infrastructure:**

    *   The `search.py` script was moved to the project root.
    *   A `huggingface-get` script was created to download models from Hugging Face without duplicating disk space.
    *   Minor fixes were implemented, including an important bug fix in `barbarella.py` regarding the file watching functionality and a general fix to the gpt-topic script
    *   Eslint was run on a few source files.

This week's progress lays the foundation for more interactive and multimodal AI experiences, bringing together voice, text, and image understanding. The focus remains on creating a flexible and customizable platform for exploring the capabilities of modern AI models.
