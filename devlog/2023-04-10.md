## Devlog: Week of 2023-04-10 to 2023-04-16

This week saw progress in several areas, including core service development, integration of the Anthropic Claude API, improvements to voice chat, and tooling for code summarization. There has been refactoring with more reliance on Llama classes for increased speed and efficiency. There was also reorganization of many existing files.

*   **Core Service Refactoring and Expansion:**  Significant work was done on the core service, focusing on directory and file API interactions. This is related to ongoing xio work (likely related to generalized input/output).  This is seen in the `core.py` commit, which was moved into the `core/` directory.
    * The `core.sh` script was updated to use Llama classes.
    * The `core.sh` script was also updated to start in the `$ALLEMANDE` directory for convenience.
    * A debugging option was added to `core.sh`.

*   **Anthropic Claude API Integration:** A new library/tool for interacting with the Anthropic Claude API was added (`anthropic/claude.py`). This includes both synchronous and asynchronous functions for querying and streaming responses from the Claude model.  The `env.sh` script was also updated to add the anthropic directory to the `$PATH`.

*   **Voice Chat Improvements and Bug Fixes:** Continued effort was put into voice chat functionality.
    * The "emo" mode in voice chat was disabled by default.
    * There were fixes related to invitation formatting in voice chat.
    * The `env.sh` script was updated to use a specific Tacotron2 model, and the interpolation was simplified.
    * All the files relating to voice chat were moved into the `voice-chat/` directory, for better organization.
    * The `bbv` script (which launches the voice chat) was renamed `bb-voice.sh`, and was updated to start a core process and the correct working directory.

*   **Code Summarization Tools:** New tools were added for summarizing code, with an initial focus on NetLogo code. These tools are located in the `code-summary/` directory.  Scripts include tools to split, sort, and describe netlogo code.
    * `netlogo-describe.sh` iterates over a set of files and generates descriptions for each function in the NetLogo project.
    * `netlogo-function-summary.sh` is used by `netlogo-describe.sh` to generate a summary of a given netlogo function.
    * `netlogo-split.sh` splits NetLogo files into separate files for each procedure.
    * `netlogo-tsort.sh` attempts to sort NetLogo files by dependency.
    * A tool was also added called `doc-in-original-order.sh`, which is meant to generate documentation from a code project.
    * Many of the above tools were moved out of the project root and into the `code/` directory, for better organization.

*   **Administrative Tooling (`adm`):**
    * A `sync-project` script was created to automate tasks like checking out the main branch, confirming add and commit, merging into other branches, and pushing/pulling. This script appears to be meant to synchronize several branches of the repository.
    * Fixes were applied to the `sync-project` script. It now uses `git add-commit` instead of `git-confirm-add-commit`. It also now merges branches using the `--no-edit` option.

*   **Embedded Interpreters:** Initial support was added for embedding interpreters for various languages (Python, Perl, Lua, Ruby, QuickJS, V8, MozJS) in C code. This involved creating Makefiles and example C files (`c/test_*.c`).
    * A cleanup of the test programs was also performed, removing some of the messier example code.
    * All interpreter files were relocated to the `c/` directory.

*   **Other Changes:**
    * The `search.py` script was moved from the project root into the `web/` directory.
    * A script `tools/safetensors-convert.py` was added to convert models to the safetensors format.
    * An "emo" mode image in place of a previous bug, shown in `pix/emotional.png`, where the model would use emojis way too much!
    * The `.gitignore` file was updated to ignore several test executable files, and the `/ports` directory.
    * User scripts were relocated from the `tools/` directory to the `user-scripts/` directory.

This week's work was heavily focused on infrastructure and organization, along with the addition of new core functionality through the Claude API and the code summarization tools.
