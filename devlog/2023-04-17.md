# Devlog: Week of 2023-04-17 to 2023-04-23

This week's focus was on enhancing the Allemande toolkit with whisper.cpp support, securing markdown rendering, improving asynchronous utilities, integrating the web UI, and streamlining the build process.

*   **whisper.cpp Integration:**  Added support for whisper.cpp, providing an alternative to the standard Whisper implementation, potentially offering performance or resource usage benefits. The `audio/whisp` script now attempts to use the standard `whisper` command. If not found, it defaults to running whisper.cpp from `/opt/whisper.cpp`.

*   **Markdown Security Enhancements:**  Significant effort was directed towards securing the rendering of markdown. This involved testing for and mitigating potential vulnerabilities related to embedding HTML, especially script tags. The `text/markdown2html-safe.sh` script, along with `text/markdown2html-safe.lua`, now uses `pandoc` with a lua filter to sanitize markdown, preventing execution of embedded Javascript. A test file (`text/markdown2html-safe-test.md`) was added to verify the security measures.

*   **Asynchronous Utilities:** Created new asynchronous iterator and generator utilities (`text/akeepalive.py` and `text/atail.py`), as well as `go/atail.go`. These utilities provide functionality similar to `tail -f`, but designed for asynchronous operations.  The `atail.py` script, in particular, avoids rewinding to the beginning of the file when the file shrinks (gets truncated). Code quality and options were also improved.

*   **Web UI Integration and Refactoring:** The web UI saw substantial progress, including integration with voice chat and the core Allemande services. There are config files for the llm_llama service. The `py/allemande.py` library was added to the project, providing a way for client programs to interact with core Allemande services. The `webui/chat-api.py` script now uses this library to send requests to the llm_llama service. Also, The web UI is now able to interface with voice chat. Changes were made to file structure and permissions for the web UI.

*   **Build Process Improvements:** Created a `Makefile` to simplify building and launching the various Allemande components.  This Makefile provides targets for running core services (LLM, Whisper), voice chat components (brain, mike, speak), and web UI elements. This involved some restructuring and removal of scripts in the `voice-chat` directory (bbv-1-brain.sh, bbv-2-mike.sh, and bbv-3-speak.sh), with their core functionality moved into Python scripts within the directory and called from the Makefile.

*   **General Improvements:** Other changes include adding a poem example, fixing minor issues with OCR and cleaning up of the code. Also, removed spam on stderr in audio/mike.py and set up logging to show the log spam with the `--debug` option. Added banner images.
