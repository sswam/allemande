# Devlog: Week of 2023-04-24 to 2023-04-30

This week's work centered around improving setup scripts, enhancing voice chat, web UI fixes and initial work on a "conductor" process for managing AI agent interactions. There was also a focus on general code cleanup and documentation.

*   **Setup and Scripting Improvements**: The installation and uninstallation scripts (`adm/allemande-install`, `adm/allemande-uninstall`) were updated to use `. get_root` instead of duplicating the root user check, which streamlines the code and centralizes root permission handling. The `sync-project` script was fixed to ensure proper synchronization of the project's branches, pulling before merging. New scripts for cleaning up spool directories (`adm/spool-cleanup`, `adm/spool-history-rm`) were added, helping manage disk space.  The `adm/allemande-user-add` script was improved to create user directories in a more concise way.

*   **Voice Chat Enhancements**: Several improvements were made to voice chat. A `toggle-mic.sh` script was added to easily mute/unmute the microphone, complete with notifications. The script now includes a timeout of 1000ms for the notification. `audio/mike.py` was updated to use the `ports` module instead of the now-defunct `allemande` module, improving modularity and clarity. Minor fixes were applied to `audio/speak.py`, changing logging level to INFO. Filter for speech text has been improved for better results with speech synthesis.

*   **Web UI Fixes and Setup:** The `adm/webui-install` and `adm/webui-uninstall` scripts were created to handle the installation and removal of the web UI, including setting file permissions and managing the Nginx configuration. An example .htpasswd file for user authentication has been created.

*   **Conductor - AI Agent Orchestration (WIP)**: Initial work was done on a "conductor" process (`chat/conductor.py`, `chat/brain.sh`, `chat/llama-chat-3.py`) to intelligently manage interactions between different AI agents within the chat application. The `chat/chat.py` file was created to handle chat file operations. The `llama-chat.py` was renamed to `llama-chat-3.py`, and a new file `chat/llama-chat.py` was created with symlink to the `chat/llama-chat-3.py` for ease of use.

*   **Screen Integration**: The project is now using `screen` for managing terminal sessions. Several helper scripts were created in `history/screen/` to simplify common screen tasks like creating windows (`sw`), attaching to sessions (`sx`, `sxw`), and sending commands (`sst`, `sstuff`).

*   **Documentation**: The README file was updated with screenshots and improved descriptions.

*   **Other Changes**: The project's `.gitignore` file was modified to ignore `.bb` and `.html` files in the `rooms/` directory.  A config file (`config/config.sh`) has been added.
