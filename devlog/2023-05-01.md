# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-01 to 2023-05-07

This week saw improvements across several areas including documentation, web interface, voice chat, infrastructure and code quality of the Allemande project. There was also exploration of integrating Claude models and table processing utilities, and first steps towards graph editing in Ally Chat.

*   **Documentation and Project Presentation:** A banner image was added to the `README` files for both the Allemande and Barbarella projects, making the project more visually appealing on GitHub.  The READMEs were also updated, with clarifications and improved descriptions to enhance clarity for new users. Additionally, a `projects.md` file was created, outlining both current and planned projects within the Allemande ecosystem, providing a roadmap and overview.
*   **Web Interface and Server Configuration:** Significant effort was directed towards configuring the web interface.  Nginx and HAProxy configurations were created and adjusted to prepare for production deployment, defining virtual hosts for various subdomains like `chat.allemande.ai` and `rooms.allemande.ai`. Installation and uninstallation scripts for the web UI were updated. Additionally, file permissions related to the web UI and user authentication were tweaked using `webui-install` and `webui-uninstall` scripts.
*   **Voice Chat and Audio Processing:** The voice chat functionality received a number of improvements. The mic confidence threshold in `audio/mike.py` was adjusted, aiming to improve the accuracy of speech-to-text transcription. Furthermore, logic was added to suppress microphone recording during speech synthesis in `audio/speak.py` to avoid feedback loops, and a lock was added to make the muting of the microphone thread-safe.
*   **AI Model Integration and Scripting:** The project is adapting to use Large Language Models (LLMs) more generally, replacing specific mentions of "GPT" in various scripts and filenames. This included renaming the `openai` directory to `llm`. Compatibility with Claude models was added, including safety settings.  Scripts for generating commit messages, summarizing text, and other tasks were updated to work with both OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude.  The default search engine used by `search.py` was changed from DuckDuckGo to Google.
*   **Table Processing Utilities:** A number of tools for processing tabular data were added. This includes scripts for converting between TSV, CSV, HTML, and other formats.
*   **Other Utilities and QoL Improvements:** Several smaller utilities and quality-of-life improvements were implemented. A script (`add-hashbang.py`) for automatically adding hashbangs to executable scripts was started.  The `sync-project` script was fixed to ensure proper branch synchronization. A variety of helper scripts for managing i3 window manager sessions were added, including scripts for balancing window sizes, focusing parent workspaces, and editing the i3 configuration.
*   **Graph Editor**: Initial work was done on a graph editor, evidenced by the creation of `graph/svg-editor.html` and experimentation with embedding HTML inside SVGs. The goal is to integrate a graphical editing feature into the Ally Chat platform.

Here's a breakdown of the changes by area:

### Documentation and Project Presentation

*   **`banner/banner*.png`**: Various iterations of the banner image were created and ultimately `banner/banner.png` was selected. All previous versions were deleted.
*   **`doc/README-allemande.md`, `doc/README-barbarella.md`**: The README files for both projects were updated, adding the banner and improving descriptions. References to WebUI were corrected to WebChat.
*   **`projects.md`**: Created to outline project plans.

### Web Interface and Server Configuration

*   **`adm/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`**: A new HAProxy configuration file was created, setting up load balancing and SSL termination for the Ally Chat platform, routing traffic based on SNI (Server Name Indication). Connection timeouts were also adjusted.
*   **`adm/nginx/allemande`, `adm/nginx/chat`, `adm/nginx/rooms`**: Nginx configuration files were added for the main Allemande website, the chat interface, and the rooms subdomain. These configure virtual hosts, SSL certificates, and proxy settings. Access to the rooms and x paths is password protected, and text/plain mime type is applied to certain file extensions.
*   **`adm/web-install`, `adm/web-uninstall`**: Created scripts for easy installation and uninstallation of web components.
*   **`adm/webui-install`, `adm/webui-uninstall`**: These files were temporarily deleted as the install process was changed, and their functionality probably merged into `adm/web-install` and `adm/web-uninstall`.

### Voice Chat and Audio Processing

*   **`audio/mike.py`**: The mic confidence threshold was adjusted, and port access was improved to use the `ports` module. A lock was added to make the muting thread-safe.
*   **`audio/speak.py`**: A `lock` parameter was added to `speak_line` to make muting of the microphone thread-safe during speech synthesis.

### AI Model Integration and Scripting

*   **`llm/*` (formerly `openai/*`)**: The `openai` directory and its contents were renamed to `llm` to reflect a more general approach to Large Language Models, moving away from a strictly OpenAI-centric perspective.
*   **`llm/llm*` (formerly `openai/gpt*`)**: All tools under the `llm` directory were renamed accordingly, to keep the `llm` prefix.
*   **`anthropic/*`**: New scripts were added for interacting with Claude, including a Python script (`claude.py`) and test files.
* **`env.sh`**: The `env.sh` file was updated to reflect the directory name change from `openai` to `llm` and included the `anthropic` directory in `PYTHONPATH`.

### Table Processing Utilities

*   **`table/*`**: A number of utilities for processing tabular data were added, including `csvproc`, `dbicsv`, `html_tables_read.py`, `recs2tsv.pl`, `tsv2csv`, `tsv2html`, and `tsv2txt`.

### Other Utilities and QoL Improvements

*   **`adm/sync-project`**: This script was fixed to pull before merging, ensuring that the project's branches are properly synchronized.
*   **`adm/spool-cleanup`, `adm/spool-history-rm`**: Two new cleanup scripts were added, and also changed to use `move-rubbish`.
*   **`future/add-hashbang.py`, `future/add-hashbang.ipynb`**: A script and related notebook were added to automatically add hashbang lines to executable scripts.

### i3 Window Manager Scripts

*   **`i3/*`**: A collection of helper scripts for managing the i3 window manager was added. These include `i3-bal` for balancing window sizes, `i3-config-edit` for editing the i3 configuration, `i3-depth` for getting the depth of the focused window, `i3-focus-workspace` for focusing the parent workspace, `i3-keys` for generating a list of key combinations, `i3-tree-simple` for printing the i3 tree layout, and `i3-workspace-split` for splitting the current workspace.

All in all, a solid week of work on the Allemande project!
