# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-08 to 2023-05-14

This week focused on enhancing Ally Chat with new features like theme customization, improved voice chat, and the integration of video-to-flashcard generation. The team also worked on infrastructure improvements and bug fixes.

*   **Web Interface and Theme Customization:**  A significant effort went into theme management, with the addition of new themes (dark-rainbow, nature, and autumn), updates to existing themes, and improvements to theme handling in the web interface. Users can now customize their chat appearance, including random theme assignment via `user-set-theme.py`. The Nginx configuration was also updated to correctly handle theme files.
*   **Voice Chat Enhancements:** Improved voice chat by refining the microphone confidence threshold and adding CUDA support for speech synthesis. Work was done to integrate `whisper.cpp` for speech recognition.
*   **Video-to-Flashcards Feature:**  The video-to-flashcards functionality was significantly improved. The directory structure was refactored, scripts were updated for better URL handling, and processing of audio and transcript data was enhanced. A web interface for video-to-flashcards was added using Gradio.
*   **Infrastructure and Utilities:**  The Allemande installation process was streamlined with updates to installation and uninstallation scripts.  A new cron job for rotating chat logs was implemented. A suite of git tools was added for easier commit management.
*   **Bug Fixes and Code Quality:**  Various bug fixes and code quality improvements were made, including fixing indentation issues in `llama-chat.py` and addressing Gradio deprecation warnings.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the week's progress:

### Web Interface and Theme Customization

*   **`adm/nginx/chat`**: Updated to redirect theme requests correctly, enabling user-specific theme selection.
*   **`webchat/static/themes/*`**: Added new themes (dark-rainbow, nature, autumn) and modified existing ones (light-old, rosy, blue, fire, forest, ocean, etc.) to improve visual variety.  Renamed `light-old.css` to `light.css`.
*   **`tools/user-set-theme.py`**:  Enhanced to enable random theme assignment using `-f` (fortune) flag, and correctly set themes.
*   **`webchat/static/styles.css`**:  Implemented fallback colors for loading to reduce flash of unstyled content.

### Voice Chat Enhancements

*   **`audio/mike.py`**: Adjusted microphone confidence threshold for improved speech recognition.
*   **`audio/speak.py`**: Added CUDA support (via the `cuda` argument) for faster speech synthesis and a `download_all_models` option.
*   **`audio/whisper-cpp.sh` & `audio/whisp`**: Continued integration work with `whisper.cpp` backend for speech recognition, improving the wrapper scripts.

### Video-to-Flashcards Feature

*   **`apps/video-to-flashcards/*`**: Refactored the directory structure, improved URL handling, enhanced processing of audio and transcript data, and modified scripts to work with new features.
*   **`apps/video-to-flashcards/video-to-flashcards-webui.py`**: Added a new web interface for generating flashcards from video URLs using Gradio.
*   **`apps/video-to-flashcards/video-to-flashcards-cached`**: Modified to delete empty output files on error, preventing caching of failed results.
*   **`apps/video-to-flashcards/video-to-flashcards.make`**: Improved the pipeline for generating flashcards from video URLs, especially the part of cleaning audio transcripts.

### Infrastructure and Utilities

*   **`adm/allemande-install`, `adm/allemande-uninstall`**:  Updated installation and uninstallation scripts for Allemande.
*   **`adm/crontab`**:  Added a cron job to rotate chat logs daily.
*   **`adm/sync-allemande`**: Renamed the synchronization script from the `git` directory to the `admin` directory.
*   **`adm/freens/allemande.ai`**: Updated DNS records for `allemande.ai`.
*   **`git/git-add-commit`, `git/git-ls-*`, etc.**: Added a suite of git tools to streamline commit management.
*   **`tools/room-rotate`**: Improved the script for rotating room files, adding file existence checks and touch commands.
*   **`allychat`**: Created symlink to `/webchat` to shorten the command to start Ally Chat.

### Bug Fixes and Code Quality

*   **`chat/chat.py`**: Improved error handling by sanitizing filenames and pathnames, and logging invalid labels.
*   **`core/llm_llama.py`**: Improved exception handling, and added CUDA handling.
*   **`gradio/runner.py`, `gradio/hello.py`**: Disabled Gradio analytics and fixed other Gradio-related deprecation warnings.
*   **`chat.vim`**: Wrapped autoread setup in `AllemandeAutoread` function for better organization.
*   **`webchat/room.js`**: Made connection status updates less noisy.
