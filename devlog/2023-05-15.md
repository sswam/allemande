# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-15 to 2023-05-21

This week saw a lot of activity, with improvements across several areas of the project. Key areas of focus were enhancing user experience with draggable items in the Kanban board, adding new AI tools and scripts, improving security with IP banning, and refining the Ikigai resume improvement app.

*   **Enhanced Kanban Board:** Items in the Kanban board are now draggable, allowing users to visually manage their workflow more intuitively. Error handling was also implemented to provide feedback on API requests.
*   **New AI Tools and Scripts:** A suite of new AI-powered tools and scripts was added, including wrappers for interacting with Google's Bard, utilities for code explanation, and scripts for streamlining common LLM tasks. Several "query" scripts were added for concisely querying LLMs, too.
*   **Security Improvements with IP Banning:** Implemented IP banning to protect against malicious activity. This involves setting up Fail2ban jails and configuring Nginx to redirect banned IPs to a dedicated "ban.html" page.
*   **Ikigai Resume App Refinement:** The Ikigai app for resume improvement received updates including better script compatibility, backup functionality, and HTML visualization for Ikigai concept.
*   **Logout Functionality Enabled:** The logout functionality was enabled and updated.
*   **Homepage Updates:** The website got some attention this week and styles and content was updated.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### Kanban Board Enhancements

The user interface for the Kanban board received a significant upgrade.
*   **`items/src/routes/Item.svelte`:** Implemented drag functionality by making items draggable and adding the `dragStart` function.
*   **`items/src/routes/Kanban.svelte`:** Improved error handling with the implementation of error handling in `fetch`, and implemented drag and drop to change item status.

### New AI Tools and Scripts

A focus on AI tooling resulted in a range of new scripts and wrappers.
*   **`llm/llm-chat-ed`:** Created `llm-chat-ed`, a new script for chatting with LLMs directly from within a text editor.  It supports prompting, and can receive a model as an option.
*   **`llm/code-explain`:** Introduced `code-explain`, a new tool designed to provide concise explanations of code, targeted for experienced developers.
*   **`llm/claude`, `llm/claude+`, `llm/gpt3+`, `llm/gpt4`:** Added new shell scripts to act as wrappers for llm, using different modes and preconfigured models.
*   **`llm/1s`, `llm/1sf`, `llm/1w`, `llm/1wf`, `llm/process`, `llm/query`, `llm/yn`, `llm/ynf`:** Added a suite of quick query tools with different output styles, from one-word answers to yes/no responses.
*   **`google/bard.py`:** Added a new Bard Python wrapper class for interacting with the Google Bard API.  The class provides state saving and resuming capabilities.
*   **`llm/llm.py`:** Integrated the retry functionality to the llm's core functions. Added chat functions for claude, bard, and gpt.

### Security Improvements with IP Banning

A new IP banning mechanism was implemented using Fail2ban and Nginx.
*   **`adm/fail2ban/*`:** Created new Fail2ban configurations for Nginx HTTP authentication (`nginx-http-auth.conf`, `jail.conf`, `jail.d/nginx-http-auth-allemande.conf`) and a banning action (`action.d/nginx-ban.conf`).
*   **`adm/nginx/*`:** Configured Nginx to check for banned IPs using `banned_ips.conf` and redirect banned users to `ban.html`. Sites configurations were moved to `sites-available` sub-dir. The file `ban-ips.conf` was added to `/etc/nginx/conf.d`
*   **`site/ban.html`:** Added a dedicated page to inform users that their IP has been banned, and providing contact info.
*   **`adm/web-install`, `adm/web-uninstall`:** Updated installation and uninstallation scripts to handle the new Nginx configuration and Fail2ban setup.
*   **`adm/web-install-pro`:** Script for installing Pro version was added.

### Ikigai Resume App Refinement

The Ikigai app for resume improvement received several updates:
*   **`apps/ikigai/*`:** The script and Makefile for the Ikigai app were updated to improve compatibility and add backup functionality. A HTML visualization for the Ikigai concept has been added, too.

### Logout Functionality Enabled
The logout functionality was enabled and updated.
*   **`adm/nginx/chat`:** The logout functionality was uncommented and enabled in the nginx configuration.
*   **`webchat/static/chat.js`:** A new `logged_out` function was added to `chat.js`, to hide the logout button when the user is logged out.
*   **`webchat/static/logout/index.html`:** The redirection logic was updated to redirect the browser to `allemande.ai` upon successful logout.
*   **`adm/webchat-user`:** The script to create and modify users and passwords was added.

### Website Improvements
The website homepage was updated:
*   **`site/css/style.css`:** Adjusted button margins and animation intervals for a better user experience.
*   **`site/index.html`:** Added logic to modify the chat link based on the environment, and other small content changes.
