# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-22 to 2023-05-28

This week saw improvements and additions across several parts of the project, with a focus on the Ally Chat platform, a document processing tool named Alfred, and the introduction of several new utilities.

*   **Ally Chat Enhancements:** A variety of fixes and features were added to improve the chat platform, including user existence checks, enhanced text processing, and new CSS themes. Significant work was also done to integrate and manage different AI models within the chat environment.
*   **Alfred Document Processor:** A new document processing tool called Alfred was created, along with a web UI. This tool supports multiple input and output formats, including text, images, audio, and video.
*   **New Utility Scripts:** Several new utility scripts were added, including tools for creating "best of" albums, searching and summarizing content, and managing code repositories.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

## Ally Chat Enhancements

This week featured many commits that refined Ally Chat's functionality.

*   **User Management:** The `adm/webchat-user` script was updated to check for user existence before adding a new user and to preserve mixed-case usernames, replacing dots with spaces. A welcome message was also added for new users.
*   **Text Processing and Formatting:** Several commits focused on improving text processing within the chat, including trimming whitespace, adding newlines, and escaping HTML tags. The default room name was also changed from 'chat' to 'Ally Chat'.
*   **AI Model Integration:**  Significant work was done to manage different AI models, including Claude and Claude Instant. Default context values were updated, and configuration options were added for Claude Instant 100k. The code for running ally_chat.py was refactored and various agents was refactored
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** A new black theme was added, along with updates to CSS styles for buttons and spacing. The chat UI was improved with line break adjustments, thumbnail handling, and fullscreen support.
*   **Security & Authentication:** Basic authentication with `.htpasswd` files was added to the Nginx configuration, including redirection and logout functionality. Access control was added to allow the room.ai subdomain. CORS configuration was added for `rooms.allemande.ai` and `chat.allemande.ai`.

## Alfred Document Processor

A significant development this week was the creation of a new document processing tool named Alfred.

*   **Core Functionality:** Alfred is designed to process various file types, including text, images, audio, and video. It can generate summaries, extract information, and convert files to different formats.
*   **Web UI:** A Gradio-based web UI was added to provide an accessible interface for using Alfred.
*   **Configuration and Dependencies:** Alfred uses a `Makefile` for managing file processing and relies on various external tools and dependencies, including `pandoc`, `ffmpeg`, and language models.
*   **Nginx & HAProxy Integration:** Configuration files were created for integrating Alfred as a subdomain (`alfred.allemande.ai`) using HAProxy and Nginx.
*   **File Processing:** Alfred can be invoked on a directory of files, where `mission.txt` will be read to specify how the LLM processes them. The results of this processing is put into an output zip file.

## New Utility Scripts

This week included an addition of new scripts, designed to streamline common tasks.

*   **"Best Of" Album Generator (`bestov`):** This script automates the process of creating a "best of" album for a given artist by querying language models, deduplicating results, and downloading tracks from YouTube. Added search utility that uses multiple models.
*    **Automated Revision Control System (`arcs`):** A system to push commits to a specific list of peers, as defined by `git config` variables. Supports pushing, pulling, and conflict resolution
*   **Giles Search and Summary Utility:** Giles automates the process of searching for information, fetching web pages, and generating summaries using Alfred. It is also makefile-based.
*   **Other New Scripts:** Several other utility scripts were added, including `eo`, `q`, `qe`, and `qo` for managing command output and `number-files` for numbering files in a directory.

Here are some additional commits:

*   **SSHFS Configuration:** Updated SSHFS mount options to include "allow_other" and "idmap=none" for improved file sharing and user mapping.
*   **Universal Speech-to-Text:** Added a user script and server component for Universal Speech-to-Text, allowing speech to be transcribed and inserted into the focused element on a webpage using the F2 key.
*   **User Typing Simulation:** Added a user script to simulate typing by pressing F3 and entering text into a dialog box.
*   **HAProxy Configuration:** Added backend rules for `alfred.allemande.ai` and `flash.allemande.ai` in HAProxy.
*   **IP Banning:** Began implementing IP banning using Fail2ban and Nginx.
*   **Documentation & Examples:** Updated README files and added an "epic" chat example showcasing the capabilities of the platform.
*    **New Favicons and CSS Styling** New website look: added and styled favicons, changed window style and added many css and font-family related rules.

This week was marked by a high level of activity, with improvements across a broad range of project components.
