# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-29 to 2023-06-04

This week saw significant progress on several fronts, including the Ally Chat platform, command-line tools, and WordPress integration. A focus on refactoring and improving existing functionality was present alongside the addition of new features and scripts.

## Ally Chat and Core Enhancements

*   **Agent Updates:** The `ally_chat.py` script saw the addition of the Bilda agent, a build automation tool that utilizes GNU Make. The Barbie agent was also added, expanding the range of available AI personalities.
*   **Command Handling Improvements:** Better command parsing by using `shlex` was implemented in `ally_chat.py`.

## Tooling and Scripting

*   **New Utility Scripts:** Several new command-line tools were introduced. This week introduced scripts for slugifying strings, extracting titles from HTML, and recursively grepping through directories listed in the PATH environment variable. These were designed to streamline common tasks.
*   **Map Search Enhancements:** The map search tools received updates, and the Google Maps tool was converted to an executable.
*   **Improved File Searching:** A `find-quick` script was added for faster file searching, designed to exclude certain large directories.
*   **Helposaurus Enhancements:** The `helposaurus` script for voice-based interaction with LLMs was improved with new options and behavior modifications.
*   **File Hiding Utilities:** The `hide-file` and `unhide-file` scripts were added for managing file visibility.
*   **Automated Revision Control System (`arcs`):** Fixes for better command handling were implemented by using `shlex`.

## Alfred and Giles Document Processing

*   **Alfred and Giles Integration:** The integration between Alfred and Giles was enhanced. The Alfred script was updated to improve parallel processing, and a topic input was added to the web UI to enrich summary prompts.
*   **Giles Improvements:** Giles was updated to use Selenium for fetching content from Facebook and Instagram. It also saves URLs to separate files. The use of multiple mission files was enabled.

## WordPress Integration

*   **Markdown to WordPress Conversion:** Improvements were made to the process of converting Markdown files to WordPress posts. A key component of this was the ability to extract sections from Markdown and inject them into WordPress with a unified look and feel.
*   **WordPress API Enhancements:** CRUD operations for WordPress pages/posts was implemented. Functionality was included for uploading normal and 2K images.
*   **Automated Posting:** Improvements were made for automated posting and improved tag replacement handling.

## Refactoring and Bug Fixes

*   **LLM Input Handling:** The `llm` tool was updated to better handle invalid UTF-8 inputs, and exponential backoff was implemented for remote LLMs to improve reliability.
*   **Dependency Management:** The dependencies file was reorganized and renamed.
*   **Code Cleanup:** Various scripts were refactored for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Claude Error Handling:** Error handling was improved for the Claude LLM, specifically addressing issues with long prompts.
*   **Slugify Issue:** A bug with the `slugify` script was fixed by renaming it to `sl_gify` to avoid conflicts with a PyPI package.
*   **Directory Refactoring:**  The table module was renamed to data, and the environment file was updated to reflect this change. The scrape functions were moved into a scrape folder.
*   **Template Parameter Handling:** Template parameters now consistently replace hyphens with underscores and are capitalized.

## New Website Look & Feel

*   **Favicons** New website look: added and styled favicons, changed window style and added many css and font-family related rules.

## New Pricing Plan

*   **Pricing Plans:** New pricing plans were added including a free plan.

Here are some additional changes:

*   **i3 Configuration:** The i3 window manager configuration was updated with new keybindings and workspaces for improved workflow.
*   **Logging:** Logging has been added to `hello.py` and throughout many scripts to improve debugging.

This week was very productive, marked by significant additions and improvements across various aspects of the project.
