# Devlog: Week of 2023-06-05 to 2023-06-11

This week focused on enhancing automation, improving document processing workflows, and refining the overall user experience across the Ally Chat platform and related tools.

## Ally Chat and Related Tools

*   **LLM Model Management:** Expanded the flexibility of language model usage by introducing dedicated variables for different summarization tasks (`LLM_MODEL_SUMMARY`, `LLM_MODEL_SUMMARY_MEGA`, `LLM_MODEL_BRAINY`) within the Alfred and Giles workflows. This allows better selection of models based on the specific task at hand.
*   **Output Format Control:** Introduced options to control output formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX) in Alfred and Giles, providing more flexibility in document processing.
*   **Automated Commit Messages:** Fine-tuned the `llm-git-commit` script with a cleanup option and improved prompt handling, enhancing the automated generation of commit messages using language models. This included fixes to the cleanup function and adding more ðŸ¤– models to choose from.
*   **Audio Processing:** Added a `silence-remover` script for cleaning audio files by removing silence, which is a useful pre-processing step for speech recognition. There were also bugfixes to the `whisp` and `whisper-cpp.sh` scripts.

## Document Processing with Giles and Alfred

*   **Giles Web Content Fetching:** The `giles_get` script now handles file extensions more robustly and uses the `extension-fix` tool to ensure correct extensions based on MIME type.  It was improved, with empty lines being skipped.
*   **Tourism and Industry Focus:** Enhanced the automation of data gathering for tourism and industry-related content. This involved renaming and refactoring scripts (`run_industry`, `run_tourism`) and updating mission files. These scripts now process lists of tourism or industry-related items, fetch data, and generate summaries using language models.
*   **Content Extraction:** Added a `headings-list` script to extract level 2 Markdown headings, facilitating content organization.

## WordPress Integration

*   **Improved WordPress Automation:** The `add_all_to_wordpress` script was improved to handle media uploads and prevent issues when moving symbolic links, streamlining the process of publishing content to WordPress.
*   **Flexible Auto Publishing:** Enhancements were made to `injectify.py` script to automatically create or update content.
*   **Content Templating:** Updated tourism mission templates and added industry mission templates.

## Scripting and Automation

*   **Streamlined Output:** Introduced `techo` and `lecho` scripts for formatted output, making command-line scripting more readable.
*   **Force Pull:** Added a `git-pull-force` script to force pull from remote branches.
*   **Full Name Setter:** Created a `fullname-set` script to easily set a user's full name.

## Infrastructure and Configuration

*   **WSL Screen Fix:** A `wsl-debian-screen-fix-run` script was added to address issues with screen in WSL environments.
*   **Font Management:**  A new font was added to the fonts directory.

## Search Enhancements

*   **Search Shortcuts:** Added shortcut scripts like `google`, `youtube` that wrap the `search.py` script. The `search.py` script was also refactored to use `argh`, and provide extra CLI options.

## Dependency and Environment Management

*   **Requirements File:** The `requirements` file was updated and the dependencies file was reorganized and renamed.
*   **Environment Variables:** Enhanced the `sync-allemande` script with environment variables for repository paths and Git commands, improving script maintainability and readability.

## Bug Fixes and Refactoring

*   **Alfred Input Handling:** Addressed an issue in Alfred where empty input would cause errors during summary generation.
*   **LLM Error Handling:** Improved error handling in the `llm` tool, increasing retries and improving exception handling, specifically addressing issues with long prompts.
*   **Directory Handling:** Several scripts were updated to handle directories and paths correctly, preventing errors related to file not found or incorrect paths.
*   **Prettify Script:** Fixed some minor issues in the prettify script.
*   **Sync allemande script**: Improved script, added env vars, and added a trap for git branch on exit or interrupt

This week involved significant code refactoring, the addition of new tools and scripts, and substantial improvements to the automation workflows for both Ally Chat and associated content generation processes.
