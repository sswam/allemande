# Devlog: Week of 2023-06-12 to 2023-06-18

This week's focus was on automating content generation, improving the content ingestion pipeline, and expanding tooling, along with some refactoring and bug fixing. There was no break since last week!

## Key Achievements

*   **Enhanced Content Generation with Giles:** Refined the `run_industry` and `run_tourism` scripts, enabling more robust and automated data gathering for specific content categories. A new `run_books` script was added to generate content specifically for book webpages.
*   **Improved WordPress Integration:** Continued work on streamlining the WordPress publishing workflow, including improvements to the `add_all_to_wordpress` script, `injectify.py`, and related templates.
*   **YouTube Category Selection Automation:** Implemented a system for automatically selecting relevant YouTube categories for videos related to generated content, improving content discoverability.
*   **Added tools:** Several new useful tools and scripts were added, and various others were improved.

## Giles: Automating Content Gathering

Significant effort was spent improving content generation using the Giles web scraping tool. Several scripts were enhanced or created.

*   **Industry and Tourism Scripts:** The `run_industry` and `run_tourism` scripts were updated, now generating content in dedicated subdirectories within a "generated" folder. These scripts also now include an `add_all` function to streamline the WordPress publishing process, utilizing a specified template. The summaries produced by Giles are now using a `dot-point form`.
*   **Book Content Generation:** A new `run_books` script was introduced, adapting the Giles workflow for generating content for book webpages. This script includes a specific template for book-related information and uses `add_all_to_wordpress` with a dedicated books template.

## WordPress: Streamlining Content Publishing

Several WordPress-related scripts and templates were improved to streamline the publishing workflow.

*   **`add_all_to_wordpress` Enhancements:** The `add_all_to_wordpress` script was improved with the addition of PARALLEL_MAX, for parallelizing work. The script now directly handles files instead of creating symbolic links, and uses the directory name as the title for injectify.
*   **`injectify.py` Improvements:** The `find_by_title` and `find_by_slug` functions in `injectify.py` were refactored.
*   **Template Flexibility:** The `add_all_to_wordpress` script was updated to accept a template file as an argument, increasing flexibility in content formatting.
*   **New templates:** A few new templates were added, specifically `template/industry.txt` and `template/books.txt`.
*   **Improved `slugify`:** Added a hyphen option.
*   **Automated backups:** Added `backup_all_wordpress` to backup draft posts to JSON.

## YouTube Integration

A new system was implemented to automate the selection of YouTube categories for videos related to the generated content.

*   **YouTube Category Selection Script:** The `youtube-select-category.pl` script automatically selects relevant YouTube categories for videos based on their titles and associated location data. The script now includes a relevance check to skip videos with titles that don't seem relevant to the place being described.
*   **Run Script:** The `run-youtube-select-category.sh` script automates the process of running the category selection script on a set of YouTube video URLs and linking the output to the tourism content generation directory.

## Tooling

*   **`vnice` script:** A tool to adjust the activity of a process by stopping and starting it.
*   **Image Focal Point Cropping:** Added `image/focal-crop.py` to resize and crop images based on focal point.
*   **Debian Setup Notes:** Added `doc/debian.txt`, `doc/extra.txt`, `doc/windows.txt` as WIP guides.

## Refactoring and Bug Fixes

Several scripts were refactored and bugs were fixed to improve code quality and reliability.

*   **`llm.py` Refactoring:** The `llm.py` script was refactored to improve error handling, add docstrings, and improve code readability.
*   **`searchalot2` Optimizations:** The `searchalot2` script was optimized by removing unused code and updating query names.
*   **Makefile Updates:** The Makefile was updated to rename build targets and dependencies, and fix issues with brain and core rules.
*   **Requirements Updates:** Updated the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-appserver.txt` files to include the latest versions of `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` dependencies.
*   **Address Format:** Updated the address format in `fusion_text`, to be more in line with requirements.
*   **Audio fix:** Ensured that unknown options are passed to `whisper` and `whisper-cpp.sh` in the `audio/whisp` script.
