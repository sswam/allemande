# Devlog: Week of 2023-06-19 to 2023-06-25

This week's work covered a wide range of improvements, including content generation, script enhancements, UI fixes, and general maintenance. No breaks since last week.

## Key Achievements

*   **Alfred WebUI Improvements:** Added input validation, improved temporary file handling, and enhanced URL downloading in the Alfred web interface, making it more robust and user-friendly.
*   **Enhanced Alfred Content Generation:** Streamlined content generation by adding topic-based text file generation, improving mission file handling, and updating pandoc commands for error tolerance.
*   **Giles and Industry Automation:** Fixed issues with media IDs in the `run_industry` script and experimented with image IDs to improve the automation of industry-related content generation.
*   **New Tools and Scripts:** Introduced new tools and scripts, including `net-watch` for network status monitoring, `code-style` for enforcing code style, `markdown-table-to-tsv` for converting markdown tables to TSV format, and zoom image tools.
*   **Chat System Improvements:** Introduced parameters to specify whether remote or local models should be used. Further work was done on the chat system, including preventing infinite bot chats and updating agent removal.

## Alfred WebUI and Content Generation

The Alfred WebUI received several important updates focused on improving usability and reliability.

*   **Input Validation:** Input validation was added for the topic, mission, and URLs in the Alfred WebUI to prevent errors caused by empty inputs.
*   **Temporary File Handling:** Temporary file handling was improved by initializing document files as an empty list if not provided, changing the temporary file prefix, and comparing files before and after URL downloading. Additionally, the `extension-fix` tool is now run on downloaded files, and `.url` files are created for them.
*   **Streamlined Content Generation:** Alfred's content generation process was streamlined by creating a `topic.txt` file from the topic variable and improving mission file handling.

## Giles and Industry Automation

Continued work on automating content gathering using the Giles web scraping tool, particularly for industry-related content.

*   **`run_industry` Script Fixes:** The `media_id` value in the `run_industry` script was corrected, and experiments were conducted with image IDs.

## New Tools and Scripts

Several new tools and scripts were added to enhance functionality and developer workflows.

*   **`net-watch`:** A new `net-watch` script was introduced to monitor network status and run up/down jobs based on connectivity.
*   **`markdown-table-to-tsv`:** A script was added to convert markdown tables to TSV format for easier data processing.
*   **Image Manipulation Scripts:** A `zoom_image.py` script was added to zoom in on specific points in an image, and an `img2img.py` script was added to convert images using an external img2img API.

## Chat System

The chat system received several bug fixes and improvements.

*   **Remote and local models can now be specified with parameters. This allows for running local models on a home PC and remote models on a server.**
*   **Infinite Bot Chat Prevention:** A bug was fixed to prevent infinite bot chats by running remote and local bots on the same server.
*   **Adult Content Agent Removal:** The agent name to be removed when not in ADULT mode was updated from "pornhub" to "Pr0nto".

## Code Style and Maintenance

Several changes were made to improve code style and maintainability.

*   **`code-style` Script:** A `code-style` script was added to rewrite scripts using a consistent code style, incorporating `argh` and `logging` where possible.
*   **`ally_mount` Script:** The `ally_mount` script was refactored to correct the unmount flag, avoid code repetition, and improve readability. The variable "unmount" was renamed to "umount".
*   **Makefile Updates:** The Makefile was updated to refactor mount-related commands, update target dependencies, and improve comments.

## Other Changes

*   **Freelancing Resources:** A list of the top 20 freelancing websites for programmers was added to the documentation.
*   **Money-Making Ideas:** Tables of money-making ideas were added to the documentation, along with an associated image.
*   **Haiku generation example:** A `haikus.sh` example script was added showing how to generate haikus.
