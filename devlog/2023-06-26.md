# Devlog: Week of 2023-06-26 to 2023-07-02

This week focused on improving content generation for both industry and tourism sectors, refining documentation, and adding some helpful tools and scripts. No breaks since last week.

## Key Achievements

*   **Giles Script Improvements:** Made significant progress in refining the Giles web scraping tool, with specific focus on industry and tourism content generation. This involved adjusting file patterns, updating query guides, and fixing variable usage for better data extraction and summarization.
*   **WordPress Integration Enhancements:** Improved the WordPress integration scripts. Specifically, the search and CRUD methods in 'injectify.py' were updated, offering more flexible content management. Furthermore, the tourism mission templates were revised to provide clearer instructions and more targeted content.
*   **Documentation Updates:** Several documentation files were updated, including those for Windows and Debian setup. These updates ensure that the documentation remains current and accurate, providing a better user experience.
*   **New Tools and Ideas:** New tools were added, such as a script for numbering Markdown headings. Ideas for new apps and tools were also captured for future development.

## Giles Refinements

Considerable time was invested in improving the Giles web scraping tool. This involved addressing inconsistencies and enhancing its ability to extract relevant information.

*   **File Pattern Adjustments:** The file wildcard patterns in `giles.make` were adjusted to ensure that the correct mission files are targeted. This resolves issues with identifying input files for the content generation process, with mission input files now using a `.txt.in` suffix.
*   **Query Guide Updates:** The query guide messages in `run_industry` and `run_tourism` were updated. These updated messages provide clearer and more detailed instructions for the AI summarization process, ensuring better quality content generation, and the query parameters for industry and tourism content were fine-tuned, leading to more focused and relevant results.
*   **Variable Corrections:** The `media_id` variable usage in `run_tourism` was corrected to properly associate media files with generated content.

## WordPress Enhancements

Significant improvements were made to the WordPress integration scripts, providing greater flexibility and control over content management.

*   **Flexible CRUD Methods:** The `find_by_slug`, `find_by_title`, `create_item`, and `update_item` methods in `injectify.py` were updated to make the `status` parameter optional. This allows for more adaptable content management workflows, enabling easier creation and modification of posts and pages.
*   **Tourism Mission Template Revisions:** The tourism mission templates were updated with clearer instructions and more specific content targets. These revisions aim to improve the quality and relevance of generated tourism content, and section headings were made consistent across mission templates.
*   **Media Handling Improvements:** The handling of media options in the `add_all_to_wordpress` script was improved, ensuring that media files are processed correctly.

## Documentation Updates

Ensuring that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date is crucial for user experience. Several documentation files were updated to reflect recent changes.

*   **Windows Setup Instructions:** The Windows setup instructions were updated to include details on installing Windows Terminal from the Windows Store and configuring it, ensuring a smoother setup process for users on Windows, now referring to "Essential WSL2 Setup" instead of "Essential WSL Setup".
*   **Debian Setup Corrections:** The Debian setup documentation was corrected with updated clone commands, package installation instructions, and virtual environment setup, streamlining the Debian installation process, specifying the Github URL for cloning.

## New Tools and Ideas

This week also saw the addition of new tools and the capture of new ideas for future development.

*   **Markdown Heading Numbering Script:** A new Perl script, `markdown_number_headings.pl`, was created to automatically number second-level headings in Markdown documents. This tool improves the organization and readability of Markdown content.
*   **App and Tool Ideas:** New ideas for apps and tools were added to the documentation. These include ideas for a mixing music/DJ app and a simplified version of Giles, providing a foundation for future projects.
*   **Code style:** Request messages now ask to reorder conditionals to check for errors and negatives first, reducing indentation.

## Other Noteworthy Changes

*   An entry in the directory list for PATH was corrected to avoid repetition.
*   The haiku generation script was updated with new topics.
*   A script was added, called "giles1", to search and summarise in a single-line version of Giles proper.
