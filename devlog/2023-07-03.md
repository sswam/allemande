# Devlog: Week of 2023-07-03 to 2023-07-09

This week I continued working on the WordPress integration, particularly focusing on the tourism templates. I've also been cleaning up and refactoring some of the template code. I had the Independence Day holiday off on Tuesday.

## Key Achievements

*   **Tourism Template Refinement:** Primarily worked on the tourism templates for WordPress, including layout changes and refinements to ensure a consistent look and feel.
*   **Template File Handling Improvement:** Added a separate file specifically designed for easy cut-and-paste import of the WordPress tourism template from Windows into WSL2.

## Tourism Template Work

The majority of the week was spent refining the WordPress tourism templates. This involved a few key changes.

*   **Layout and Style Adjustments:** I switched the layout of the tourism template from a full-width design to a single-column layout. I also made several style and layout changes throughout the template to improve readability and visual appeal, and moved the map to be above the social sharing section.

## Template Import Improvement

To streamline the process of transferring the complex tourism template file from Windows to WSL2 for editing, I created an auxiliary file.

*   **Dedicated Import File:** I created an additional file (`tourism_import.txt`) specifically for copying the template content from Windows into WSL2, where I use vimdiff for comparing and merging changes. This addresses the challenges of directly editing the template file across different operating systems and environments.
