# Devlog: Week of 2023-07-17 to 2023-07-23

This week was focused on improving the Debian installation process, refining Windows setup instructions, and adding some new utility scripts. A lot of work went into streamlining the setup for new developers and users.

## Key Achievements

*   **Debian Installation Script Improvements:** Significant enhancements to the Debian installation scripts, including splitting the original `debian.txt` into executable scripts, improved prompts, dependency management, and SSH key handling.
*   **Windows Setup Guide Refinement:** Updated the Windows setup guide with more detailed instructions, including disabling Windows Defender and installing useful tools.
*   **New Utility Scripts:** Added several new bash and perl scripts to the `tools` directory, providing helpful command-line utilities.

## Debian Installation Script Details

The bulk of the week was spent making the Debian installation process smoother and more automated.

*   **Script Division:** The original `debian.txt` file was split into two executable bash scripts, `debian-1.sh` and `debian-2.sh`. This allows for a more organized and step-by-step installation.
*   **Enhanced User Prompts:** Improved the prompts in `debian-1.sh` to display user settings more clearly and ensure correct configuration.
*   **Dependency Management:** Streamlined the process of installing dependencies in `debian-2.sh`, including handling for `soft-ai` related repositories. This involved cloning repositories directly from git and installing specific versions of packages. The install path for the `python3.10-distutils-bogus` deb file was corrected as well.
*   **SSH Key Handling:** Improved SSH key generation and distribution to servers in `debian-2.sh`, ensuring secure key creation and simplified connection setup.
*   **Apt Configuration:** Ensured `apt` package management instructions use `apt-get` format for consistency.
*   **Removed gTTS and Gradio** The libraries gTTS and Gradio are temporarily removed from dependecies by being commented out.

## Windows Setup Guide Updates

The Windows setup guide was updated to provide clearer and more comprehensive instructions.

*   **Windows Defender Instructions:** Added instructions on how to disable Windows Defender Antivirus through the group policy editor.
*   **Software Installation:** Specified the installation of `windirstat` as a helpful tool.
*   **Refined Instructions:** General improvements to the wording and flow of the instructions for setting up the Windows Terminal and configuring default settings.

## New Utility Scripts

Several new scripts were added to the `tools` directory to improve command-line workflows.

*   **`wich` and `W`:** Added `wich` script to find the full path of a command or file in PATH. The `W` script was replaced with a symlink to `wich`
*   **`usage`:** Script for displaying usage information.
*   **`i`:** A script that performs an action in a specified directory.
*   **`cw`:** Script that displays the contents of an executable
*   **`lw`:** Script that lists information about a file found with `wich`
*   **`vw`:** Script that opens the files given as arguments for editing with `vi`
*   **`uniqoc`:** Perl script to print unique lines with counts
*   **`kut`:** Perl script to keep only specified columns in a text file.

## HTML Processing Scripts

Scripts added to `/www` directory for processing HTML.

*   **`htmlsplit`:** Perl script to split HTML into lines.
*   **`de`:** Perl script to decode HTML entities.
*   **`web-title`:** Bash script to extract the title from a webpage.

## Miscellaneous

*   **.gitignore Update:** Added a rule to ignore all hidden files.
*   **`llm-git-commit` Fix:** Adjusted file path handling in `llm-git-commit` script to correctly handle git repository context.
*   **`web-install` fix** The web-install script now uses `service stop` and `service start` commands instead of `systemctl restart` for Nginx and HAProxy.
