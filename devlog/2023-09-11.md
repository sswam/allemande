# Devlog: Week of 2023-09-11 to 2023-09-17

This week saw a couple of small but interesting additions to the project. I was away for 7 weeks. It's good to be back!

## Key Achievements

*   **'Lex' Interview Application Idea Document:** Started outlining ideas for a new AI-powered interview assistant application, codenamed 'Lex'.
*   **Improved `find-quick` Tool:** Enhanced the `find-quick` utility by adding 'venv' to the exclusion list, improving search efficiency.

## 'Lex' - AI Interview Assistant

This week I started fleshing out ideas for a new application called 'Lex'. The goal is to create an AI assistant to help with conducting interviews. The idea spawned from thinking about how to best capture the life stories of elders, but the potential use cases extend far beyond that. Think meeting facilitation, personal development, or even project planning.

Some planned features include:

*   Standalone AI interviewer mode, or collaborative mode with a human interviewer.
*   Mission awareness: the AI would be aware of the overall goals of the interview.
*   Agenda management: helps define and dynamically adapt a plan for the interview session.
*   Voice chat integration with speaker identification and optional AI speech synthesis.
*   Contextual understanding by summarizing previous discussions.

I also brainstormed some potential development options, such as using speech synthesis based on the elder's own voice to produce audio books and enabling the LLM to mimic the style of the elder's speech. The initial ideas were documented in `apps/lex/idea.txt`.

## `find-quick` Tool Update

The `find-quick` tool is a handy utility for quickly locating files. I've updated it to exclude 'venv' directories from the search, further refining the search results. Virtual environments can contain many files, and excluding them improves search speed and reduces irrelevant results.
