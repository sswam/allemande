# Devlog: Week of 2023-09-18 to 2023-09-24

This week focused on improvements and new features for Ally Chat, particularly around AI model integration, chat processing, and brainstorming new AI applications.

## Key Achievements

*   **Anthropic API Update**: Updated the `claude.py` file to support the latest Anthropic API, including changes for Claude 2.
*   **Mission File Integration**: Enhanced chat processing to incorporate mission files, providing context for AI agents.
*   **AI Application Brainstorming**: Developed new AI application ideas, including an AI legal document generator and an interactive fiction co-creation tool.
*   **Chat UI Design**: Began designing a new chat UI.

## Anthropic API and Claude 2 Support

The highlight of the week was updating the `claude.py` file to work with the new Anthropic API and Claude 2. This involved several changes, including setting the default model to Claude 2 and adjusting the token limit. I also added logging configuration to suppress unwanted messages from the `httpx` library.  Hopefully the token limit is 100k for all models now; I still need to test with `claude-1`.

## Mission File Integration

I've incorporated "mission" files into chat processing. The idea is to provide additional context to AI agents. The system now loads a `.m` file (if present) associated with a `.bb` chat file and prepends the mission information to the context provided to the AI. This allows us to steer the AI towards specific goals or topics. It feels a little bit hacky, and there are some known issues where the context provided to the AI might contain partial messages. I've applied a temporary fix to address this.

## Brainstorming AI Applications

I spent some time brainstorming new AI applications, documenting the ideas in `ideas/claude-ideas.md`. Some of the concepts include:

*   An AI that generates legal documents by analyzing client wishes and applicable laws.
*   Interactive fiction generation where the AI co-creates a story with a human author.
*   An AI that generates personalized nutrition plans based on genetics, biometrics, and lifestyle factors.
*   An AI system that generates possible legal arguments for a given case based on analyzing large datasets of historical cases and outcomes.

I also started thinking about improvements to the query-response format, exploring ideas like incorporating confidence scores, outlining the AI's thought process, and adding dedicated sections for mission context and character information.

## New Chat UI Design

I've begun working on a new chat UI design. The initial design is documented in `doc/AllemandeFramework.pdf`.

## Other Improvements

*   Added a markdown syntax setting in the Allemande function in `chat.vim` for better formatting.
*   Created a file (`bugs/anthropic-version.txt`) to record an error message encountered when querying "Clia" without the required `anthropic-version` header.
