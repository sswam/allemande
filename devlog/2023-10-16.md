# Devlog: Week of 2023-10-16 to 2023-10-22

This week was dedicated to improving Ally Chat's web content processing and exploring ideas about LLM training. I had two weeks off.

## Key Achievements

*   **Idea about training with less knowledge**: I added an idea to train LLMs with less general knowledge.
*   **Improved `pandoc-dump`**: I enhanced the `pandoc-dump` script to handle metadata and conditionally display it.
*   **Refined HTML cleanup**: I made improvements to the `pandoc-dump-clean-html` script for better HTML cleaning and content extraction.
*   **Web summarization testing**: I updated the `web-summary-test.sh` script to analyze web pages with Claude and ChatGPT tokenization modes.
*   **Bug fix**: I commented out a faulty line in `pandoc-dump-clean` pending review.

## Idea about training with less knowledge
I've been pondering whether LLMs could be more efficient if they weren't burdened with so much general knowledge. I added a file, `ideas/knowledge.txt`, outlining the thought that perhaps reducing the need for memorization might free up resources for reasoning and problem-solving. The idea is that we can provide knowledge to LLMs as input, and then it doesn't need to memorize it. This ties into the concept of providing requisite knowledge in the context during training, so the LLM learns to rely on the information given rather than pre-existing knowledge.

## Improved `pandoc-dump`

I've enhanced the `pandoc-dump` script, which is used to convert HTML to Markdown. I've added a new variable to control whether metadata (title and URL) should be displayed. A new function, `show_metadata`, handles the display of this information. The script now also separates the HTML cleaning process.

## Refined HTML Cleanup

The `pandoc-dump-clean-html` script, which cleans HTML before conversion, has been improved. I've added regular expressions to remove the "References" section, which is common in Wikipedia articles. I've also added functionality to extract the main content within `<main>` or `<article>` HTML tags, focusing the output on the core article content.

## Web Summarization Testing

I've updated the `web-summary-test.sh` script, which is used to analyze and summarize web pages using different AI models. I've updated the script to accommodate Claude and ChatGPT tokenization modes, updating variable stats tracking to accommodate the new Claude and ChatGPT tokenization modes, as well as to track token counts. I also output the URL to `url.txt` within the target directory, for easier review.

## Bug Fix

I've commented out a line in `pandoc-dump-clean` that appeared to have a typo. The line, which was intended to filter out `data:image` URLs, was malformed and therefore ineffective. I've left it commented out pending review to determine the original intent and implement the correct fix.
