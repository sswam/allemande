# Devlog: Week of 2023-11-06 to 2023-11-12

This week saw improvements to Ally Chat's AI model selection, the introduction of an asynchronous retry mechanism, and refinements to the web content cleaning scripts.  Also there was some mucking around with haproxy, adding a new subdomain for routing. I had two weeks off again.

## Key Achievements

*   **GPT-4 Turbo Integration**: Updated Ally Chat to use GPT-4 Turbo, with the option to override model IDs.
*   **Asynchronous Retry**: Created a new asynchronous retry function in Python.
*   **Pandoc Cleanup Fixes**: Implemented minor fixes to the Pandoc cleanup scripts.
*   **HAProxy Configuration**: Added a new subdomain to the HAProxy configuration.

## GPT-4 Turbo Integration

I've upgraded the platform to use the new GPT-4 Turbo model. I've also added the ability to override the model ID in the configuration. This allows for greater flexibility in selecting and testing different AI models and versions within the Ally Chat environment. This change ensures we're using the latest and greatest OpenAI models while retaining control for experimentation.  The original "gpt-4" is now available as "gpt-4-orig". Also added claude-2 for future use.

## Asynchronous Retry Function

I've created a new asynchronous retry function, `aretry`, in Python. This function allows us to retry asynchronous operations that might fail intermittently, with configurable parameters for the number of retries, sleep duration, and handling of specific error types.  It should improve the stability and resilience of the platform.  If an error is deemed unrecoverable, or the retry count is exceeded, the exception is re-raised.  There is a test function included.

## Pandoc Cleanup Fixes

I've made some minor fixes to the `pandoc-dump-clean` and `pandoc-dump-clean-html` scripts.  In `pandoc-dump-clean`, a typo in a regular expression that was supposed to filter out `data:image` URLs has been fixed. I've also removed a backslash from the end of the line, and other minor fixes. The intention of removing data images needs to be verified.

In `pandoc-dump-clean-html`, I've tweaked the regular expressions used to extract content from `<main>` and `<article>` HTML tags, allowing for more flexible content extraction.

## HAProxy Configuration

I've added a new subdomain, `flipit.allemande.ai`, to the HAProxy configuration. This will allow us to route traffic for this subdomain to the appropriate backend service (nginx).
