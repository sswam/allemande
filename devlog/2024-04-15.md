# Devlog: Week of 2024-04-15 to 2024-04-21

This week I added a couple of new utility scripts, expanded context for GPT-4 in Ally Chat, and tweaked the haproxy config and i3 layout. Before this week, I hadn't done any work for several months.

## Key Achievements

*   **New Utility Scripts**: Added `json2csv.py` and `wikitext-get.sh` for data processing.
*   **Expanded GPT-4 Context**: Increased the default context window for GPT-4 in Ally Chat.
*   **HAProxy Configuration**: Added new sites to the HAProxy configuration.
*   **i3 Layout Adjustments**: Fixed some issues in the i3 layout configuration, including a fix to the `Makefile`.

## Utility Scripts

I've added two new utility scripts. `json2csv.py` is a Python script that converts an array of JSON objects to a CSV file. It takes JSON data from stdin and writes the CSV output to stdout. This should be useful for data analysis and manipulation. The other script is `wikitext-get.sh`, a simple bash script that retrieves the wikitext content of a Wikipedia page using the Wikipedia API. It takes the page title as an argument and outputs the wikitext. Now I can scrape away at Wikipedia...

## Expanded GPT-4 Context

I've increased the default context window for GPT-4 in Ally Chat from 10 lines to 20. This should give the AI model more context when responding to messages, potentially leading to more coherent and relevant responses. I'm hoping this improves the overall chat experience. More context is generally better, until it starts costing too much.

## HAProxy Configuration

I've added new sites, `flipit_dev.allemande.ai` and `chatpal.allemande.ai`, to the HAProxy configuration. This allows us to route traffic for these subdomains to the appropriate backend services (for clients). This is fairly straightforward infrastructure stuff.

## i3 Layout Adjustments

I fixed a couple of issues in the i3 layout configuration. Specifically, I renamed a workspace from "brain-local" to "brain" in the layout JSON and adjusted the corresponding title in the swallows configuration. Also fixed a typo in the Makefile that was preventing the i3 layout from being applied correctly. This stuff is vital for managing windows and workspaces.
