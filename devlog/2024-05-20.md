This week was short and sweet. The primary focus was integrating the new GPT-4o model into Ally Chat.

## Key Achievements

*   **GPT-4o Integration:** Added support for the GPT-4o model within the Ally Chat platform.

## GPT-4o Integration

The main task this week was incorporating the new GPT-4o model into Ally Chat. This involved adding the model to the `llm.py` file, including its ID and description, and updating the model selection logic to use the new ID when "gpt-4" is selected. I also made sure to log the selected model for debugging purposes. The "cost" of the model is currently set to the same as the previous GPT-4 model, but this may need adjustment. I'm looking forward to seeing how it performs in real-world chat scenarios! I have high hopes, but reality often disappoints.
