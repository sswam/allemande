# Devlog: Week of 2024-06-17 to 2024-06-23

This week saw some crucial updates to the Ally Chat backend, primarily focused on OpenAI API compatibility and improved error handling. I've had three weeks off again! Not working on the project much lately.

## Key Achievements

*   **Updated OpenAI API Usage:** Modified the `llm.py` file to use the updated OpenAI API, resolving compatibility issues.
*   **Implemented Asynchronous Retry Mechanism:** Introduced an `aretry.py` module with an asynchronous retry function to handle transient errors gracefully.
*   **Minor Bug Fix:** Corrected a typo in the command-line arguments for `llm.py`.

## OpenAI API Update

The OpenAI API has been updated, and this week I migrated our code to ensure compatibility. The key changes involved instantiating the `OpenAI` client and updating the method for creating chat completions. I replaced the older `openai.ChatCompletion.create` with `openai_client.chat.completions.create`, and adjusted the way the response message is extracted. This should keep Ally Chat humming along with the latest OpenAI goodies.

## Asynchronous Retry Mechanism

I've added an asynchronous retry mechanism to the codebase. This is essential for handling transient errors that can occur when interacting with external APIs. The `aretry.py` module provides a function called `aretry` that allows us to retry an asynchronous function a specified number of times, with configurable sleep intervals. This will make Ally Chat more robust and resilient to temporary hiccups in the AI backend. This is especially needed since we have so many models from many vendors.

## Minor Bug Fix
I fixed a typo in the `llm.py` file. The `-p` command line argument for line-by-line processing was accidentally set to `-x`. This has been corrected.
