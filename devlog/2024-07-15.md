# Devlog: Week of 2024-07-15 to 2024-07-21

This week focused on integrating a new "mini" model and tweaking some existing AI configurations within Ally Chat. We're aiming to give users a wider range of choices to suit their needs and budgets. I'd had another three weeks with no work.

## Key Achievements

*   **Added `gpt-4o-mini` Model:** Integrated the new `gpt-4o-mini` model, offering a fast and affordable option for users.
*   **Updated Claude Models:** Refreshed some of the Claude model configurations to stay current.

## `gpt-4o-mini` Integration

We've added the `gpt-4o-mini` model to Ally Chat. This model is designed to be an affordable and intelligent choice for users who need fast performance on less demanding tasks. I've configured it within our `llm.py` file with the abbreviation "4m" so it's easy to reference. The model boasts a low cost of $0.002, making it a budget-friendly alternative for many applications within the platform. It's now available as an option in Ally Chat, sitting alongside the other models like GPT-4 and the Claude family.

## Claude Model Updates

I updated the Claude models we offer to version 3. The `claude-2` model is now just called `claude` and given the ID `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`. The `claude-instant-v1` model is now called `claude-haiku` and its ID is `claude-3-haiku-20240307`.
