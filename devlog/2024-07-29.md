# Devlog: Week of 2024-07-29 to 2024-08-04

This week was all about adding some new LLM tooling, improving our scripting capabilities, and getting some sync processes ironed out. I also took some time to improve the commit message generation script. I've had a week off again.

## Key Achievements

*   **Enhanced LLM Scripting:** Added new scripts for streamlined processing and querying of LLMs, plus a script to view recent generations.
*   **Improved Logging:** Separated log files for prompts and answers from our LLM interactions, making debugging easier.
*   **Subtitle Extraction:** Created a new script to extract subtitles from video files.
*   **Improved Sync Scripts:** Added syncing with the Barbarella GitHub repository and reordered commands in the Allemande sync script.
*   **Commit message improvements**: Improve `llm-git-commit` to avoid adding code blocks into the commit message.

## LLM Scripting Enhancements

I spent a good chunk of the week adding new tools to make working with LLMs from the command line easier. The new `llm-last` script is a simple way to view the most recent generations from the `llm.log` file. You can specify how many recent generations you want to see, and even output the filenames instead of the content, which is handy for finding specific interactions.

Additionally, I created `llm/proc` and `llm/que`, two new bash scripts for more concise processing and querying of LLMs. These scripts streamline the interaction with the LLMs by providing default instructions to reply concisely, without boilerplate. The `proc` script is intended for processing tasks and `que` for simple queries. I had to tweak the instructions a bit after initial implementation, removing a directive to prevent comment removal, which wasn't always desirable. The `llm/process` script now handles cases where no arguments are provided, preventing errors.

To improve the overall debugging experience, I separated the logging of prompts and answers into separate files. Now, there will be `prompt.*` and `answer.*` files, making it easier to trace the input and output of each LLM interaction.

## Subtitle Extraction Script

I created a new script called `video-subtitles` to extract subtitles from video files using `ffmpeg`. This script makes it easy to grab subtitles in SRT format. The script includes an option to clean up the output by removing unnecessary lines like timestamps, making the subtitles cleaner and easier to work with.

## Sync Script Improvements

I modified the `sync-allemande` script to also sync with the Barbarella GitHub repository. This ensures that the latest changes from both repositories are pulled and pushed correctly. I also reordered the pull and push commands in the script to ensure that all pulls happen before any pushes, preventing potential conflicts.

## Commit message improvements
I improved the `llm-git-commit` script to exclude lines starting with ``` from commit messages. This prevents code blocks from being included in the commit message, which improves readability.
