# Devlog: Week of 2024-08-12 to 2024-08-18

This week focused on fixing an issue with our Hugging Face integration. I've had a week off again.

## Key Achievements

*   **Fixed Hugging Face Download Authorization:** Added authorization headers to the `wget` command within the `huggingface-get` script to ensure successful downloads.

## Hugging Face Download Fix

A bug prevented downloads from Hugging Face due to authorization issues. It turns out the `wget` command in our `huggingface-get` script was missing the necessary authorization header. To resolve this, I added an `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token using the `$HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` environment variable. This ensures that downloads are properly authenticated and can proceed without errors, in the case of gated repositories.
