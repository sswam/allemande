# Devlog: Week of 2024-08-26 to 2024-09-01

This week focused on refining our tools for handling emails, improving LLM-powered commit message generation, updating the Claude API integration, and making various environment and code improvements.

It was my birthday on Saturday!

## Key Achievements

*   **Email Handling Improvements:** Created a suite of tools for fetching, cleaning, and summarizing emails, including scripts for removing links and images, cleaning HTML, and fetching from IMAP servers.
*   **Enhanced LLM Commit Message Generation:** Improved the `llm-git-commit` script by adding a bug checking step before generating commit messages.
*   **Claude API Update:** Updated our Claude integration to use the latest Claude 3 API and models.
*   **Environment Configuration:** Refactored various scripts and makefiles to use environment variables for LLM model references, improving configuration and flexibility.
*   **Web UI Refactoring:** Replaced deprecated input/output components in the web UI for Alfred and Flash apps.

## Email Handling Tools

A significant portion of the week was dedicated to creating and refining email handling tools. These tools aim to automate the process of fetching, cleaning, and summarizing emails, making it easier to extract valuable information from large volumes of messages.

I created several new scripts:
*   `email_clean.py` cleans email content by removing non-text attachments and unnecessary headers.
*   `email_fetch_and_summarise.sh` fetches emails from an IMAP folder, cleans them, removes links, and generates a summary using an LLM.
*   `imap_fetch.py` fetches unread emails from an IMAP server. It can list folders with unread counts, fetch emails (either the full content or just metadata), and mark emails as read.
*   `remove_links.py` filters out links and image references from email text.

These scripts were initially created in the `tools/` directory, then refactored into a dedicated `email/` directory. The `env.sh` script was updated to include the new directory in the PATH.

Several improvements were made to these scripts:
*   The `imap_fetch.py` script was improved to be more robust and readable, and also list folders with unread emails.
*   The `email_clean.py` script improved charset handling and decoding of HTML content.
*   The `remove_links.py` script now filters links and images.

## LLM Commit Message Generation

The `llm-git-commit` script was enhanced to improve the quality of generated commit messages. A bug checking step was added before generating the commit message, prompting the LLM to review the patch for bugs before generating the message. The prompt used for bug checking was updated to be more thorough. Additionally, the commit message generation prompt was updated to focus on describing the actual changes in the diff, following the Conventional Commits spec.

## Claude API Update

The Claude integration was updated to use the latest Claude 3 API and models. This included updating the default and instant model names, adjusting token limits, and refactoring the `chat_claude` function to use the new messages API format.

## Environment Configuration

To improve configuration and flexibility, I refactored several scripts and Makefiles to use environment variables for LLM model references. The `ALLEMANDE_LLM_DEFAULT` and `ALLEMANDE_LLM_DEFAULT_CHEAP` environment variables were added to `env.sh`, and various scripts were updated to use these variables instead of hardcoded model values. This makes it easier to switch between different LLM models without modifying the scripts themselves.

## Web UI Refactoring

The web UI for the Alfred and Flash apps was refactored to replace deprecated input/output components. The `default` attribute was changed to `value` in input components, and `gr.inputs.*` and `gr.outputs.*` were replaced with `gr.*`.

## Time Handling Scripts

A new script, `add_durations.py`, was created to sum multiple HH:MM time strings. Another script, `subtract_time.py`, was created to subtract two times. The `subtract_time.py` script was updated to handle negative time differences and raise a ValueError if the time difference is negative.  A `subtract_time.sh` script was also created to handle time differences in bash.

## Other Improvements

*   The `civitai_images.py` script was updated to rename arguments to snake\_case and add argument types for `argh.arg` decorators.
*   A script was added for adding promting to bug reporting in generated messages.
*   The `llm-last` script was updated to add an option to view markdown files in Chrome using the Markdown Viewer extension, and log file extensions were changed to `.md`.
*   The `adm/allemande-install` script was updated to fix user setup and environment configuration.
