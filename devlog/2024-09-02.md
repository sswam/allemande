# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-02 to 2024-09-08

This week saw continued improvements to our email handling tools, enhancements to the LLM-powered commit message generator, and some general code cleanup and improvements.

## Key Achievements

*   **Email Tooling Refinements:** Further enhanced our suite of email processing scripts, focusing on improved error handling, folder listing capabilities, and user experience.
*   **LLM Commit Message Generation Enhanced:** Improved the `llm-git-commit` script with a better bug review process and added safety measures.
*   **Time Handling Scripts Improved:** Modified `add_durations.py` and `subtract_time.py` to use simple integer arithmetic instead of datetime objects.
*   **Improved Error Logging:** Added error type to logged messages for more informative output for all the scripts.

## Email Handling Improvements

I continued refining the email handling scripts this week. The `email_fetch_and_summarise.sh` script now creates the parent directory for the output folder if it doesn't exist, preventing errors. A confirmation step was added before summarization, allowing for a sanity check. The script also now calculates and displays the token count of the email text before summarization. The user variable in summary prompt is now given via an environment variable.

The `imap_fetch.py` script received some significant upgrades. It now supports the `XLIST` command for listing folders, falling back to the standard `LIST` command if `XLIST` isn't supported by the IMAP server.  A new `--all` parameter was added to include folders with no unread emails when listing folders. The output format for folder listing was also improved for readability. Finally, I improved the error logging to include the exception type and message, making debugging easier. The `list_folders` function was refactored to use `folder_status` for better performance.

## LLM Commit Message Generation

The `llm-git-commit` script had a few key improvements this week. I added a confirmation step before running the bug check, preventing accidental or unwanted bug reviews. The prompt used for bug checking was updated to allow listing of important issues or suggestions in addition to bugs, and to clarify the expected output format. To prevent problems, I moved a shell function to fix a bug when you hit ^C.

## Time Handling Scripts

The `add_durations.py` and `subtract_time.py` scripts were refactored to use simple integer arithmetic instead of the `datetime` module. This allows them to handle times and durations over 24 hours, which is useful for tracking longer periods. Error handling and docstrings were also improved for clarity.

## Error Logging

The `hello.py` script was updated to include the error type in logged messages. This provides more informative error output, helping to avoid inscrutable errors.
