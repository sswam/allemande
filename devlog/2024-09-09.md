# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-09 to 2024-09-15

This week's work focused heavily on improving our code generation and refactoring tools, adding support for processing various types of media, enhancing the LLM integration, and reorganizing the codebase.

## Key Achievements

*   **Enhanced Code Generation and Refactoring:** A suite of new scripts were added to assist with code generation, refactoring, and styling using LLMs.
*   **Media Processing Tools:** Added tools for subtitle processing and synchronization.
*   **LLM Enhancements:** Expanded LLM capabilities with model aliases, improved commit message generation, and flexible token stopping criteria.
*   **Codebase Reorganization:** Refactored code to improve organization and maintainability, including moving code-related scripts and miscellaneous utilities to more appropriate directories.
*   **Markup Processing Scripts Added:** Introduced scripts for markup processing, indenting, and validation.

## Code Generation and Refactoring Tools

This week saw the addition of several tools focused on streamlining code-related tasks. A basic program generator script, `prog`, was created to quickly generate simple Python programs based on a "hello world" template. The `code_rework.py` script allows for AI-assisted code refactoring by providing a prompt and a set of files, generating a new version of the primary file. `code_style` helps improve code quality by rewriting a script to match the style of a reference script. A script to determine the language of a file by its extension, `code-language.py`, was also added. Additionally, a script named `doc` was implemented for generating basic code documentation using the `process` command.

## Media Processing Tools

I added tools for subtitle processing and synchronization. The `subs` directory now includes `buflines.py` for buffering line output with a configurable sleep delay, `cleanup-scanned-script.py` for cleaning up messy scanned scripts, `save_subs.lua` for saving subtitles using `mpv`, and `script_sync.py` for synchronizing scripts with subtitles. A `watch_with_ally.sh` script was created to simplify watching movies with AI assistance in Ally Chat, leveraging the new subtitle processing tools.

## LLM Enhancements

The LLM integration received several improvements. Model aliases were added to the LLM configuration, allowing for more flexible model selection. The `llm-git-commit` script was enhanced with improved instructions for commit message generation, including emphasizing high-level descriptions for features and conciseness. Configurable diff context was added to `llm-git-commit` to control the amount of diff information sent to the LLM. I started adding flexible token stopping criteria, but NOTE THIS IS NOT WORKING YET!

## Codebase Reorganization

Several refactoring tasks were completed to improve the codebase structure. Code-related scripts, including `ce`, `code-explain`, `llm-code`, and `llm-git-commit`, were moved from the `llm` directory to the `code` directory. Miscellaneous utility files were moved to the `snip` directory. The `geo` directory was created and populated with geo-related files, such as `map-find-google.py` and `map-find-mapbox.py`.

## Markup Processing Scripts

I added markup processing scripts to the `markup` directory. `markup_indent.py` indents and validates markup tags and `markup_split.py` splits markup into separate lines based on tag boundaries. I added `env.sh` script to include 'markup' directory in PATH.

## Other notable changes

A new `files` directory was added, along with a `cat_named.py` script to concatenate files with headers. A `timezone` lookup tool and data generation script were added to the `geo` directory. A fix was added to update LlamaTokenizer initialization to use `legacy=False`. A prototype file-based client-server system for accessing LLMs was described in a README in the `core` directory. The `move` tool was renamed to `move-rubbish`, but this change was not preserved, so I've removed the reference. A shell script `hello.sh` was added for code example.
