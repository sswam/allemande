# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-16 to 2024-09-22

This week's development work spanned several key areas: improving Bash scripting utilities and tests, enhancing LLM-based tools, adding new code analysis capabilities, and working on various utility scripts related to text, files, planning, and more.  I also took some time to reorganize and refactor existing code for better maintainability. It was a busy week!

## Bash Scripting and Utilities

Significant effort went into refining Bash scripting tools and adding comprehensive tests.

*   **`opts` Script Enhancement:**  The `opts` script, used for Bash option parsing, was improved with better usage function and corrected a bug to support main functions.
*   **`hello.sh` Script Refinement:** The `hello.sh` script was enhanced with AI-powered greetings, code style improvements, and various refinements such as refactoring into a function, and is now BATS testable. It now accepts short options.
*   **BATS Testing:** Comprehensive BATS tests were added for `hello.sh` to ensure its functionality, and comments were added that explain how to run the tests and use the various options in the script.

## LLM-Based Tools

The integration with LLMs was expanded with new tools and enhancements to existing scripts.

*   **New Helper Scripts:** Several new "one-liner" LLM scripts were added, `1sp` (single sentence) and `1wp` (single word) for simpler interactions.
*   **`comment.sh`:**  This new script uses AI to add comments to code and creates header comments with CLI usage.
*   **Model Handling Improvements:**  The default model was now being correctly quoted. A bug with redundant choices for the model code was fixed. Unused Claude advice was removed. The default "cheap" small model was renamed in the config to "small".
*   **Refactoring/Style Enhancement:** The `improve.sh` script helps rewrite code with AI in the style of `hello.sh`, for a standardized baseline.
*   **File handling enhancements:** The `code_modify` helper was implemented to refactor common functions into `ally.sh`
*   **`todos.sh`:** This script now processes TODO, FIXME, and XXX comments, and it will retain comments.

## Code Analysis and Utilities

New tools were added to help with code analysis, text manipulation, and file management.

*   **`find-todos`:** A script to find TODO comments in a project.
*   **`ignore.sh`:**  A script to easily add file paths to `.gitignore`, relative to the git root.
*   **`indenter.py`:** This script can now detect and apply indentation automatically and the default indent can be based on the file type.
*   **`find-elf`:** A new tool to locate ELF files.
*   **`code-language.py`:** A new tool to determine code language of a file by its extension.

## Miscellaneous Utility Scripts

Several new utility scripts were added for various purposes.

*   **`run_then_wait.sh`:** A simple script to run a command and then wait for user input or a timeout.
*   **`note.sh`:** A script for adding notes to markdown files, with various options for different note types, file locations, and summaries. A `-p` option allows specifying initial text.
*   **`pomodoro.sh`:** A basic Pomodoro timer script.
*   **`waywo.sh`:** A script to periodically ask "What are you working on?"
*   **`TextCorrector`:** Implemented in python, this script handles complex broken text correction.
*   **`text/sub.pl`:** A perl script for flexible text substitution.
*   **`i3_update_message.sh`:** A script to update custom i3status message.
*   **`tty_cursor_pos.c`:** A C program to detect the cursor position.

## File Management and Organization

Improvements were made to scripts for file management and codebase organization.

*   **`rubbish` Scripts:** The rubbish bin scripts, `copy-rubbish` and `move-rubbish`, were improved and renamed from `tools`.
*   **`canon` Script:** This script creates symlinks for executable and `.sh` files.
*   **`modify` Script:** A script to apply a command to multiple files, keeping the original copies in the rubbish bin.

## Text Processing

New text processing utilities were added, including one for converting PDF files to text.

*   **`markdown_number.py`:** A tool to add or remove numbering from Markdown headings or lists.
*   **`pdfocr.sh`:** A script to convert PDF files to OCR-processed text.

## Web-Related Scripts

One new script was added for use with web pages.

*   **`web_summary`:** A script to fetch webpage and provide summarization.

## New Libraries and Dependencies
* A Perl module `ally/main.pm` was created to help with logging and IO.

## Planning and Documentation

Project plans and documentation were expanded to better define the project roadmap.

*   **Design Documents:** Design documents for a visual task tracker app were added, including a build plan and design chat transcript.
*   **Business Plan:** A comprehensive business plan for Allemande AI was added.

## General Improvements and Refactoring

Several changes were made to improve the overall codebase.

*   **Environment Setup:**  The `env.sh` script was updated to include new directories in `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` and the Ally module was relocated.
*   **Dependency Updates:**  The `requirements.txt` file was updated to include new dependencies.
*   **Code Examples:** A simple "Hello, World!" script in Python was added as a code example.
