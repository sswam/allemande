# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-30 to 2024-10-06

This week was extremely busy and productive, with many new features, improvements, and refactoring efforts across almost all areas of the project. The focus was on enhancing the AI capabilities, streamlining file management, improving code consistency, and building out new components for the web UI. This devlog will attempt to summarise this extremely prolific week and won't invent anything, only mention what is evident from the code and commits.

## Key Highlights

*   **Alias Management**: Centralized alias management by introducing a "canon" directory and updating symlinks.
*   **AI Integration**: Improved several AI tools, especially by adding async support in more functions and increasing LLM integration.
*   **Code Style Improvements**: A concerted effort to modernize and format code, including renaming files, adding extensions, and consistent coding practices.
*   **File Handling**: Significant enhancements in file handling tools, such as those for splitting, joining, and cleaning files.
*   **Test Automation**: Added more BATS and Python tests, and improved the test infrastructure.
*   **Web UI Development**: Continued work on web-related components, including adding PWA support and lazy loading.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Alias Management

One of the core goals for this week was to better manage aliases and make them more consistent across the project.

*   **"Canon" Directory**: A new "canon" directory was created to house canonical versions of scripts and tools.
*   **Symlink Updates**: All aliases were updated to point to the canonical versions in the "canon" directory. This provides a single source of truth for each tool and makes maintenance easier.
*   **Script Renaming**: Many scripts were renamed to use underscores (snake\_case) for consistency.
*   **Symlink Creation**: The project added new symlinks for frequently used scripts and tools, further streamlining workflows.
*   **Symlinks Update** The alias script was updated to point to canon directory.

### AI Integration

This week showed an amazing burst of activity, focused on incorporating AI capabilities.

*   **Async LLM Functions**: Code got an update by making several chat functions `async`.
*   **Model Aliases**: The project got updates for LLM aliases, and also added support for the latest models.
*   **File Conversion**: New tools, such as a specification generator for the A2B universal file converter, were added to support AI-driven processes.
*   **Translation Script**: There was a new translation script added, `translate.sh`, to translate files from one format to another using AI.
*   **Interview Script**: There was a new AI-driven interview script added for interactive conversations.
*   **Personal Project Manager**: Another exciting feature, an AI-powered personal project manager, has been developed.
* **Quoting Utilities**: The Ally library got new Quoting utilities, mainly for use in tests.

### Code Style Improvements

Another significant focus area was improving the overall consistency and style of the codebase.

*   **File Renaming**: Many files were renamed to use snake\_case, which is a more consistent naming convention.
*   **Extension Adding**: File extensions were added to many scripts and configuration files to help improve file recognition.
*   **Bash Option Handling**: There were code updates that streamline bash option handling.

### File Handling

File handling capabilities were also enhanced.

*   **File Joining and Splitting**: The project enhanced file joining and splitting scripts.
*   **Junk File Detection**: There was a new tool added to find junk and empty files.
*   **File Update**: A file update utility with content comparison was added to avoid unnecessary updates.

### Test Automation

This week had lots of activity on test automation.

*   **BATS Framework**: A BATS testing framework was added.
*   **BATS AI Test** New BATS tests support AI, but require a flag to run because AI calls are too expensive to include in every single test.

### Web UI Development

The project saw development on the web UI as well.

*   **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA) support was added.
*   **Favicon Generation**:  There was also a new script added for generating favicons.
*   **Multi-Column Layout**: CSS styles were added for responsive multi-column layouts.
*   **Web Summarization**: A script was added to fetch, summarize, and API-ify web content.
*   **Fast Web**: Lazy loading was implemented for images.

## Specific Tasks

*   **Guide Script**: Code got updates in the form of an AI-powered personal project manager.
*   **Audiobook Summarization**: Makefile was added for automated audiobook summarization.
*   **Multi-Way Diff**: There was a new script implemented to perform multi-way diff, but it has not yet been tested.
*   **Code Statistics**: The new tool, `code-language.py`, can now determine the code language of a file based on its extension.
*  **Code Swapping** there was a new script to swap code contents.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Stable Diffusion**. There were ongoing struggles to set up and debug the image viewer and SDXL text-to-image generation tools.

## Looking Ahead

There is a plan to continue to focus on code consistency and performance issues. In particular, there will be a focus on:

*   **More LLM Refinements** Streamlining CLI tools and standardizing workflows for LLM-based tasks.
*   **Portals** Continue to develop the PortClient class.

I am especially excited about the prospect of streamlining the command-line tools with the new tooling around `ally.sh`.
