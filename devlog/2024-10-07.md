# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-13

This week was extremely productive, with significant advancements in AI tooling, code standardization, and usability enhancements.  A big focus was placed on streamlining script execution with `ally.sh` and introducing new command-line tools.

## Key Highlights

*   **Ally Integration**: Continued migration to the `ally.sh` framework for simplified option parsing and improved script structure.
*   **AI Tooling**: A plethora of new AI-powered scripts were introduced, including code generation, text manipulation, and content summarization.
*   **File Management**: Enhanced file handling utilities including scripts for finding duplicate lines, managing rubbish, and standardizing script names.
*   **Web UI Enhancements**: Continued work on the Ally Chat web interface, including UI tweaks, PWA support, and performance optimizations.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Ally Integration

The ongoing effort to integrate tools into the Ally ecosystem continued this week.

*   **Script Modernization**: Scripts were refactored to use `ally.sh` for a standardized command-line interface and dependency injection.
*   **Parameter Passing**: Existing scripts were cleaned up and rewritten to take command options from `ally.sh`.

### AI Tooling

Many of the new additions this week centered on enhancing AI-assisted workflows:

*   **Code Improvement**: Tools like `improve.sh` and `messy.sh` were significantly enhanced to help automate code improvement and Git commit message generation.
*   **Text Manipulation**: The Project added tools such as `praise.sh` and `roast.sh` to generate playful text with AI, tools to rewrite text such as `simple.sh` and `clarity.sh`, and also a script to translate text.
*   **Content Summarization**: There were AI tools added for summarizing content in several ways.
*   **File Conversion and Generation**: The Project got new utilities such as automatic API doc generation and file conversion for conversion between data formats.
*   **Commit Tool Updates**: `messy` and `messy-xterm` got updates for easier use of LLMs to help with commits.
*   **Code Formatting** The Ally framework got a Style module to apply coding styles on Python and bash files.

### File Management

Several tools were created or enhanced to handle file management tasks:

*   **Rubbish Management**: Rubbish files can now be moved and backed up.
*   **File Finding**: Scripts such as "wich" and "find" and `ls-which` make it easy to find files and file locations.
*   **Name Checking**: There were updates to code that make it easier to check that files have canon names.
*   **Curate**: The `curate.sh` utility provides an interactive way to organize files into directories.
*   **Multi-Way Diff**: There were updates to make the multi-way diff tool testable, though it is still experimental.
*   **Swapping**: A code swap utility was added for code contents.

### Web UI Development

Development continued on the web-based Ally Chat interface:

*   **UI Updates**: New updates to the pricing page layout.
*   **Performance**: There were code updates that implement lazy loading for web images.
*   **PWA support**: Progressive Web App support was added.
*   **Voice chat**: New scripts were added, and an attempt to use onnxruntime for LLM, but the code has not yet been committed or tested.

## Specific Tasks

*   **Dependency Tracking**: Utilities were added to track file dependencies and make symlinks in `usr/local/bin`.
*   **Rich text processing**: Parallel code was added to rich text processing to make it much faster.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Legacy Code**: Moving more core functionality to the new `ally.sh` command handling is proving complex but very rewarding. The main hold-up here is the sheer size of the required modernization effort.

## Looking Ahead

Plans for the next week include:

*   **Portals**: Continue to develop the PortClient class.
*   **Ally Tests**: Add unit tests for the modules around the new Ally CLI framework.
*   **Code Swapping** Make it easier to use code swap function.
*   **More LLM Refinements** Streamlining CLI tools and standardizing workflows for LLM-based tasks.

I am very pleased with progress towards a unified `ally.sh` framework for handling CLI options and other functions, and especially excited about the potential of the Portals framework.
