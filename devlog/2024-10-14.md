# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-14 to 2024-10-20

This week saw substantial progress across multiple areas, with a strong focus on improving existing tools, adding new AI capabilities, and streamlining the codebase.  A key theme was further integrating with the `ally` framework and enhancing the user experience. I also spent some time planning the next steps for the project.

## Key Highlights

*   **Ally Framework Enhancement:** Significant strides were made in improving and utilizing the `ally` framework for option parsing, input/output, and logging, resulting in cleaner and more consistent code.
*   **AI Tooling Expansion:** A range of new AI-powered tools were added, including those for code refactoring, text completion, and content summarization.
*   **Web Chat Improvements:**  Continued refinement of the web-based Ally Chat interface, including asset management and chatbot improvements.
*   **File Management and Utilities:** New file management tools and enhancements were implemented for managing junk files, finding files, and other common tasks.
*   **Planning:** I spent some time thinking about what direction to go in, documented in `current.md`.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Ally Framework Enhancements

The `ally` framework is becoming increasingly central to the project.

*   **`geput` Refactoring:** The `geput` module, responsible for handling input and output, was significantly refactored. It now provides a more consistent and simplified interface for various I/O operations.  This included adding `print` and `input` wrappers and removing the newline stripping from `titty`.
*   **Logging Improvements:** The logging system was enhanced, with the `context` decorator gaining improved argument formatting. More comprehensive tests were added to increase confidence in logging functionality.
*   **`opts_help` and `opts_long` Improvements:** The `opts_help` and `opts_long` scripts in the `bash` directory were enhanced to provide better command-line option handling and help message generation, taking advantage of `ally`'s option parsing capabilities.
*   **Code Migration**:  `hello_py.py` and `hi_py.py` were updated to use the `geput` module for I/O. This follows the drive towards a more unified framework and cleaner script structure.
*   **Removal of `argh`**: In the effort to unify around the `ally` option parsing framework, the project began phasing out `argh`, with tools and tests for refactoring and converting existing code.

### AI Tooling Expansion

The set of AI-powered tools continues to grow.

*   **Code Refactoring Tool:** A "WIP" (Work In Progress) `ally-refactor.py` tool was introduced to automate the process of refactoring Python code to adhere to the `ally` framework.  This is designed to help convert existing scripts to the new I/O and option parsing standards.
*   **Text Completion Tool:** A new `complete.py` script was added, enabling text completion using local LLM models.  It supports streaming output and context management.
*   **Improve Script Enhancements:** The `improve.sh` script was enhanced to better handle file editing, test integration, and user prompting.
*   **Chinese Whispers Game**: The Project added a LLM-based "Chinese Whispers" translation game with `whispers.py`.
*   **Brain.sh update**:  The `brain.sh` script for running the LLM chatbot was updated to use `ally`'s option parsing and now calls `ally-chat` instead of the old `ally_chat.py`.
*   **Summary Improvements**:  The `summary` tool now gives as compact a description as possible, in a single line.

### Web Chat Improvements

Development of the web-based Ally Chat continues.

*   **Asset Management:** Favicon and icon files were centralized in a `pix` directory, with app-specific files replaced by symbolic links. This improves maintainability and consistency.

### File Management and Utilities

*   **Junk File Management:** The `junk_files.sh` script was enhanced to include a "remove" option, allowing it to move identified junk files to the rubbish.  File matching was also improved.
*   **Find Scripts:** The various `find` scripts were moved to the `files` directory, and `find-quick` was added to `/usr/local/bin`, providing more convenient access to frequently used file searching tools.
*   **Git Tools:** A new `git_today.sh` script was added for viewing recent commits. The `fmt_commit.py` script was updated to use `geput` and improve typing for better I/O handling. `git_commit_groups.sh` had a bugfix:  the script will now continue execution even if the user chooses not to remove junk files.
*   **TSV Processing:** Enhancements were made to TSV processing capabilities, including the addition of a `tsv_number_columns.py` script for adding column numbers to TSV files.  `tsv2txt.py` now has a `gap` parameter and can count leading tabs as spaces.
*   **Coro_merge:** A coroutine based file merging tool was added.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Legacy Code**:  Integrating more core functionality to the new `ally.sh` command handling is proving complex but very rewarding. The main hold-up here is the sheer size of the required modernization effort.
*   **Code Standards**:  The push to conform to code standards has created a large backlog of conversion work, and it can be difficult to apply standards retroactively.

## Looking Ahead

Plans for the next week include:

*   **Refactor Tool**: I plan to continue working on the Ally refactoring tool, aiming to automate more of the conversion process to the ally framework.
*   **IO**: Re-factor the ally IO system and make it testable.
*   **Portals**: Work on developing the PortClient class.
*   **Testing**: Add unit tests for the modules around the new Ally CLI framework.
*   **AI integration**: I want to integrate more AI features into the platform, but some of the infrastructure isn't there yet.

I'm excited about the progress made this week towards a more unified and maintainable codebase. The new AI tools are also opening up possibilities for automating development tasks and enhancing the user experience.
