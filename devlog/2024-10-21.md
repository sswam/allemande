# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-21 to 2024-10-27

This week was very busy, with a focus on refining existing functionality, expanding the capabilities of Ally Chat with AI-powered tools, and improving overall code quality through linting and testing. I dedicated significant time to refactoring existing C and shell scripts to adhere to code standards, particularly by adding the Ally option parsing library for consistency. Also, I was having some trouble getting speaker diarization to work well so worked on getting some basic test infrastructure set up.

## Key Achievements:

*   **C and Shell Script Modernization:** Made substantial progress in modernizing C and shell scripts by incorporating the `ally` library for argument parsing, improving code structure, and adding robust tests.
*   **AI Tooling Expansion:** Expanded Ally Chat's AI capabilities with image and video generation functionality, age estimation tools, and improved code review scripts.
*   **Refactoring and Code Cleanup:** Continued refactoring existing tools and scripts for better modularity, readability, and maintainability.
*	**Speech Processing:** Added infrastructure to make speech diarization work, and made some tests of models to estimate the age of people.

## Detailed Breakdown

### C and Shell Script Modernization

A major focus was on modernizing existing C and shell scripts and bringing them in line with our project's coding standards.

*   **Hello C**: I made the AI-powered greetings and shopping list from last week more flexible by adding support for command-line options for customization with `ally` and unit tests, providing better usage examples, and documenting the dependencies of the sea library for running commands and IO.
*   **GLX Gears Restructuring:** The `glxgears` program was refactored to improve modularity, with the `main` function split into smaller, focused functions. The CLI options were also updated to follow code conventions.
*   **Bash Script Standardization:** Several bash scripts were converted to use the `ally` option parsing framework, including `hello_sh.sh`, `cp_a_ignore_time_errors.sh`, and `huggingface_get.sh`, `backup.sh`, and `gent.sh`, as well as many minor changes. Guidance on bash style was added to the documentation. As part of this the `opts_help.py` was updated to convert underscores to dashes in the options.
*   **New Shell Tools**: Many new shell tools were added for performing useful operations, including tools for output redirection with and without error messages, all with names that begin with "quiet-".

### AI Tooling Expansion

I expanded the AI functionality available in the Ally Chat platform by:

*   **Image and Video Generation:** Added new AI features for image-to-text, text-to-image, and text-to-video functionalities, with a command-line interface. The initial goal is to give users image and video generation capabilities from chat2.py.
*   **Age Estimation:** I am interested in how AI can be used for safety purposes so started work on age estimation, adding several age estimation models and scripts using the Civitai, Ageless Faces, and dima806 datasets. `watch-changes.sh` was introduced for watching for new images in the directory and running the estimation when the changes happen.
*   **AI Code Review**:  Expanded AI tools for development by adding an AI-generated code review for `llm.py`, which is designed to identify potential improvements, creative ideas, and code weaknesses.
*   **Guidance**:  AI model can be prompted for the style of a program.  Added new language-specific guidance files for C and Python programming.

### Refactoring and Code Cleanup

*   **File Management**: I moved the `refactor.py` script to the `gen` directory and renamed `chunk.py` to `chunk_text.py` for consistency. Obsolete code snippets were moved to the `snip` directory for archival purposes.

### Test infrastructure
*   **Added tests**: Started adding tests for the core C code.
*   **Test timeout**: Added support for timeouts to the test runner to ensure test runs complete without indefinite waiting.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Legacy Code**:  The effort to convert code to `ally` is proving complex, and it can be difficult to apply standards retroactively, especially working out the best way to use logging and option parsing.
*   **Reliability**: Some of the AI tools added were only tested by the AI model. Further work is required to ensure the AI is doing the right thing with those and more robust unit tests.
