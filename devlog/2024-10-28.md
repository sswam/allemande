# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-28 to 2024-11-03

This week was focused on expanding Ally Chat's capabilities with new tools and features, including image classification, model downloading from CivitAI, enhanced Selenium integration, audio playback, bash scripting improvements, and advancements in the AMPS language design. Also, the Debian install scripts were updated, and there was a lot of polish on existing code and documentation.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Image Classification:** Implemented image classification using FastAI, including model fine-tuning and streamlined classification scripts.
*   **CivitAI Model Downloader:** Added a tool to download models from CivitAI with API key support, simplifying the process of acquiring and integrating new AI models.
*   **Selenium Enhancements:** Improved Selenium integration with cookie support, scrolling with element selector support, and better browser control options.
*   **AMPS Language Design:** Created initial documentation for the AMPS language design, outlining core language goals, features, implementation approaches, and a rollout plan.
*   **Bash Scripting and Tooling:** Added new bash scripting capabilities and helper scripts for output and file handling.
*   **Debian Setup Improvements:** Updated Debian setup script with editor selection, SSH key specs, and other improvements.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Image Classification

I added image classification using fastai with features for classifying individual images and processing them in batches.

*   **Image Classification Script:** I implemented `image_classify.py` for classifying images using a fastai model. The script supports both individual and batch image prediction functions.
*   **Model Fine-tuning:** The image classification tool now supports model fine-tuning, allowing for better accuracy and adaptation to specific image datasets.
*   **Streamlined Image Classification:** I improved the image classification scripts by streamlining the classification process and providing a more user-friendly interface.
*   **Fixes:** Fixed command-line flags in `illustrate.py` to properly handle boolean values and the output parameter name.

### CivitAI Model Downloader

*   **Model Downloader:** A new tool has been added to download models from CivitAI, simplifying the integration of new AI models into Ally Chat.  The downloader supports specifying the model ID or URL, as well as an API key for authentication. Version selection (downloading a specific version or all versions) is also supported.

### Selenium Enhancements

I spent time improving the Selenium integration with better browser control options.

*   **Cookie Support:** Selenium integration now supports cookie persistence between browser sessions and improve webpage scraping.
*   **Scrolling with Element Selector:** Added the ability to scroll specific elements using a CSS selector.
*   **Browser Control Options:** Enhanced browser control options for Selenium, including the ability to run in non-headless mode and manually control the browser.
*	**SVG Realization:** Added a JavaScript script to process SVG elements.
*   **Renamed get_selenium:** Renamed the `get_selenium.py` script to `selenium_get.py` for clarity and consistency.

### AMPS Language Design

I started to create initial documentation for the AMPS language design.

*   **Core Language Documentation:** The documentation outlines core language goals, features, implementation approaches, and a prioritized rollout plan. The documentation explores different implementation approaches, focusing on the language's goals and features, such as a relation-based approach, bidirectional evaluation, and multiple representations.

### Bash Scripting and Tooling

I've added shell tools and improved existing ones.

*   **Bash Utilities:** Many new bash tools were added for performing useful operations, including tools for output redirection with and without error messages, all with names that begin with "quiet-".
*   **Argument Requirements:** Added `needargs.sh` to require a minimum number of command-line arguments.
*   **Function Calling:** Added a `call()` function to `ally.sh` to run a bash function by name and handle missing functions gracefully.
*   **Test Utilities:**  Added helper scripts for testing and file handling: `canon.sh` for running `make canon`, `fail_on_output.sh` to fail if a command produces any output, `slurp.sh` to read an entire file, and `wat.sh` to watch a command repeatedly.
*   **Code Linting and Formatting:** Implemented `formy.sh` and `linty.sh` for code formatting and linting, with support for binary file detection and Perl module handling.

### Documentation and Style

I worked on improving documentation and code style.

*   **Git Commit Template:**  Improved formatting and clarity in the message template for git commits.
*   **Windows setup**: Improved Windows setup steps, replaced Barrier with Input-Leap as recommended KVM solution, and added Terminal bell config to flash taskbar only, less disruptive.
*   **Perl and Bash Style:** Added documentation for guidance on bash and perl style.
*   **No Translation Note**: Added a note in `hello_sh.sh` and `hello_c.c` telling LLMs not to translate suggestions back to English.

### Debian Setup

I addressed some issues in the setup scripts and added features.

*   **Setup script improvements:** The Debian setup script was updated to include editor selection, SSH key specifications, and a note about pip install issues. The script now updates Python 3.10 to 3.11 and improve install steps. The script filter for commented lines in `debian-packages.txt`.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Legacy code**: The effort to convert code to `ally` is proving complex.
*   **Robustness**: Ensuring robustness of AI tools is proving complex.
