# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-04 to 2024-11-10

This week was all about improving existing tools, adding new functionalities to Ally Chat and focusing on code quality and robustness. I added YOLO object detection, improved environment variable handling, and enhanced the Civitai integration. There were also improvements to bash scripting, option parsing, and various utilities, along with some Python script conversions and the introduction of AMPS module demo files.

## Key Achievements:

*   **YOLO Object Detection:** Implemented YOLO object detection with bounding box output for image analysis.
*   **Environment Variable Handling:** Enhanced environment variable detection and activation, ensuring more reliable and secure script execution.
*   **Civitai Integration:** Improved Civitai model and image handling, including model version information and cursor-based pagination.
*   **Bash Scripting Improvements:** Made several updates to bash scripting capabilities.
*   **Options parsing updates:** Updated CLI argument parser.
*	**Python conversion**: Ported several scripts to `python3-allemande`.
*	**AMPS Demo Files:** Added demonstration files for the AMPS module, developed while talking with Gemini Flash.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### YOLO Object Detection

I added object detection functionality using the YOLO model, which allows Ally Chat to analyze images and identify objects within them, providing bounding box coordinates.

*   **YOLO Integration:** Implemented `image_detect_yolo.py`, which uses the YOLO model to detect objects in images. The script provides options for outputting bounding box coordinates, center coordinates, or an empty array if no objects are detected.
*   **Output Options:** Users can choose between center coordinates, full bounding boxes, or an empty array as output.
*   **Visual Display:** Added an option to display a visual window with object detections.

### Environment Variable Handling

I improved how the system handles environment variables.

*   **Improved Variable Detection:** Enhanced `env-detective` to use word boundaries and handle comments correctly, improving the accuracy of environment variable detection.
*   **Virtual Environment Activation:** Modified `env.sh` to only activate the virtual environment if no other environment is already active, preventing conflicts.

### Civitai Integration

I made changes to enhance the Civitai integration, making it easier to download and manage AI models from Civitai.

*   **Cursor-Based Pagination:** Refactored the Civitai image fetching code to use cursor-based pagination, improving efficiency and reliability.
*   **Model Version Information:** Improved the Civitai model downloader to display the base model and training words in the output, providing more context about the downloaded models.
*   **Model Renaming:** Renamed the `civitai_models` module to `civitai_models_1` to avoid naming conflicts and improve code organization.
*   **Model Downloading:** Added the `civitai_models` script to facilitate downloading models from CivitAI and improved the `civitai_images` script.

### Bash Scripting Improvements

I added shell tools and improved existing ones.

*   **Formy/LInty/Testy Fixes:** Fixed an issue where `formy`, `linty`, and `testy` commands were displaying the wrong message for binary files.
*   **File Existence Check:** Added a file existence check in `formy`, `linty`, and `testy` commands to prevent errors when the target file is not found.

### Options parsing updates

I updated CLI argument parser

*   **Argparse Type Handling:** Updated `ally/opts.py` to improve argparse type handling for lists and optional arguments, providing more flexibility in defining command-line options.
### Tool updates

I've added tools and improved existing ones.
*	**Weight conversion:** Added a tool to convert between pounds and kilograms.

### Logging

I have streamlined logging.
*   **Logging Restructuring:** Restructured the logging system to include `get_log_level_numeric()` and `get_log_level()`, making it easier to check log levels programmatically.

### Python conversion

I've converted scripts to `python3-allemande`

*   **Python Script Conversion:** Converted numerous Python scripts to use `python3-allemande` to ensure they are executed within the correct environment.

### Alias Fixes:

*	**Text-strip:** The `tstrip` alias now uses Python for improved robustness and proper handling of trailing newlines.

### AMPS Module Demo Files:

*	**AMPS Demo Files:** Added demo files for the C, Python, and Shell AMPS modules, providing examples of how to use the AMPS language for different programming languages.

### Refactoring

*   **Git Commit Groups:** Renamed `git_group_files` to `git_commit_groups` for clarity.
*	**Haproxy**: Simplified `haproxy` config and prepared for client includes

## Challenges Faced

*   **Ensuring script robustness**: Various scripts require testing to ensure they don't break unexpectedly.
*   **Legacy code**: Updating older code continues to be a time sink.
