# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-11 to 2024-11-17

This week's focus was primarily on implementing JWT authentication for Ally Chat, refactoring existing code for better readability and portability, and improving some utility scripts.  A significant effort was dedicated to migrating existing basic authentication to the new JWT system across various components.

## Key Achievements:

*   **JWT Authentication Implementation:** Introduced a new JWT-based authentication system for Ally Chat, enhancing security and user management.
*   **Nginx Configuration Updates:**  Migrated Nginx configurations from basic authentication to JWT authentication across several subdomains.
*   **Utility Script Improvements:** Enhanced various utility scripts, including scripts for managing Allemande home directory detection and haproxy configuration.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Improved code readability by reordering and grouping functions in the `curate` script and other modules.
*   **New Utility Scripts:** Added utility script for converting between binary and hexidecimal formats, and processing RFC 2822 header files.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### JWT Authentication

The main highlight of this week was implementing JWT authentication for Ally Chat. This involved creating new authentication services, updating Nginx configurations, and adding client-side authentication logic.  JWTs are now used for authentication across various subdomains of `allemande.ai`.  The `auth` service stores bcrypt password hashes in an `.htpasswd` file, and it adds users to the system in the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files with `/usr/sbin/nologin` as the shell initially. The user also has a homedir created, in `/home/$username`.

*   **Authentication Service:** Added an authentication service using FastAPI, with endpoints for login and logout. This service manages user authentication and generates JWT tokens.
*   **JWT Token Creation:** Implemented functions to create and verify JWT tokens, ensuring secure communication between the client and server.
*	**Password storage**: Storing password hashes in the `.htpasswd` file and using `passlib` to verify passwords.
*   **Cookie Handling:** Improved cookie handling, including setting `httponly`, `secure`, `domain`, and `samesite` attributes for enhanced security.
*   **Nginx Integration:** Configured Nginx to use the `ngx-http-auth-jwt-module` for authenticating requests, replacing basic authentication with JWT authentication.
*   **Client-Side Authentication:** Added client-side JavaScript code to handle login, logout, and JWT token storage in cookies.
*   **Cross-Domain Logout:** Implemented cross-domain logout functionality, ensuring users are logged out across all Ally Chat subdomains.
*   **Username-Based Login:** Switched from email-based login to username-based login, improving user experience and privacy.
*   **Improved User Tracking:** Enhanced user tracking during logout, logging which user is logging out for auditing purposes.
*   **JWT Module Build Script:** Added a script to clone the TeslaGov JWT module and rebuild Nginx with it, using `metadeb` to manage build dependencies.

### Nginx Configuration Updates

The Nginx configuration was extensively updated to integrate the new JWT authentication system.

*   **Configuration Migration:** Migrated Nginx configurations from basic authentication to JWT authentication for `chat.allemande.ai`, `rooms.allemande.ai`, `alfred.allemande.ai`, and `flash.allemande.ai` subdomains.
*   **JWT Authentication Module:** Added a script to update the Nginx configuration with the JWT secret, ensuring secure authentication.
*   **Reverse Proxy Configuration:** Configured reverse proxy settings for the `/x` endpoint, forwarding requests to the authentication service.
*   **Timeout settings**: Increased the client/server timeouts to 10min in the `haproxy` configuration.
*   **No Absolute Redirects**: Turned off absolute redirects on vhosts (allows relative paths in redirect).
*   **Cookie handling**: Added support for enabling CORS with credentials for cross-domain requests.
*	**Correct username**: Passing JWT `sub` rather than (basic auth) `remote_user` for user identity.
*	**JWT Redirects**: Turned off JWT redirects for locations serving APIs and iframes, so we will return 401 Unauthorized not redirect to an HTML login page for those.

### Utility Script Improvements

Several utility scripts were improved to enhance functionality and portability.

*   **Allemande Home Detection:** Enhanced the `python3_allemande.sh` script to automatically detect the Allemande home directory if it's not set in the environment.
*   **Haproxy Configuration Management:** Added a script to manage haproxy configuration updates, improving the deployment process.
*   **Root Env Preservation**: Keeping PATH/PYTHONPATH/PERL5LIB when escalating to root (via `get-root` shell script).

### Code Refactoring

Code refactoring was performed to improve readability and maintainability.

*   **Function Reordering:** Reordered and grouped functions in the `files/curate.sh` script for better readability.

### New Utility Scripts

New utility scripts were added to provide additional functionality.

*   **Binary-to-Hex Conversion:** Added a binary-to-hex conversion utility (`data/binhex.py`), allowing for encoding and decoding binary data in hexadecimal format.
*   **RFC 2822 Header Processing:** Added a script (`text/headersproc.pl`) to process RFC 2822 header files, providing basic support for reading and writing UTF-8 encoded header files.
*	**File locking**: Added synchronous and asynchronous file locking, using `fcntl.flock()`.

## Challenges Faced

*   **JWT Implementation Complexities:** Implementing JWT authentication required careful attention to detail to ensure security and proper integration with existing systems.
*   **Nginx Configuration Management:** Managing Nginx configurations across multiple subdomains was challenging, requiring meticulous updates and testing.
*   **Async bugs:** A number of bugs were identified in the async server code. Testing and refactoring is required to resolve the issues.
