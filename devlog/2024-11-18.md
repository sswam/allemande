# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-18 to 2024-11-24

This week has been incredibly busy, with a lot of work across various parts of the Allemande AI ecosystem. A major theme has been continued refinement of the Ally Chat platform, with a strong focus on the LLM integration, interface improvements, and infrastructure tweaks.  There was also significant progress made on utility scripts and initial explorations into game development.

## Key Achievements:

*   **LLM and Chat Improvements:**  Significant improvements to Ally Chat's Large Language Model integration, including better handling of GGUF models, improved markdown layout, and a more streamlined interface.
*   **Utility Script Enhancements:**  A plethora of new and improved utility scripts were added, focusing on data manipulation, file handling, and system administration.
*   **Game Development Started:** Initial steps taken in game development, including a simplified game engine and curriculum-related project scripts.
*   **Ally Chat PWA and Notification Work:** Preliminary steps taken to turn Ally Chat into a Progressive Web App with push notification support.
*   **Ally Portals Improvements:** The Allemande portals code has been improved and cleaned up for better maintainability.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### LLM and Chat Improvements

The core focus remained on enhancing the AI capabilities of Ally Chat.  A major goal was to improve the model loading and interface for GGUF models, which allows use of lower resource language models, especially on local machines. Also addressed was the problem of multiple AIs in a room talking to each other, and the goal has been to limit the replies to one per model.

*   **GGUF Model Support:** Implemented `llama-cpp-python` to support GGUF models in Ally Chat. This provides a wider range of models and configurations for chat agents.
*   **Chat Interface Tweaks:** Improved the Ally Chat markdown layout, math rendering, and context handling. Notably doubled newlines are now used between messages for better readability.
*   **Agent Behaviour Adjustments:** Tweaked agent settings for GPT-4 models (increased context window), and fixed an issue causing duplicate search calls.  Also disabled unsafe and adult agents, and fixed a case issue with one of the adult-oriented agents.
*	**Allemande Portals Renamed**: `ALLEMANDE_PORTS` environment variable was renamed to `ALLEMANDE_PORTALS` and code was updated to comply. This was done in a commit that also moved the `ports.py` module to `ally/portals.py` and renamed the class and functions inside.
*   **LLM Service Loop:** Added a sleep to the LLM service restart loop to prevent excessive resource consumption.
*   **Stopping Criteria:** Switched from token-based stopping criteria to a new streaming/regexp approach for LLM generation. This improves the quality and reliability of generated text.

### Utility Script Enhancements

A large number of utility scripts were created or improved this week, improving the overall usability and automation of various tasks.

*   **Data Transformation:**  Added scripts for handling text and TSV file transformations, such as `txt2tsv`, `guess_columns`, `kutc`, and `tsv-tidy`. The new `csv_tidy.py` script handles CSV files with quoted fields and whitespace stripping.
*   **File Handling:** Added utility for splitting files and managing backup files, now using the trash (rubbish bin) instead of leaving them in `/tmp`.  Also added synchronous and asynchronous file locking using `fcntl.flock()`.
*   **System Administration:** Added scripts for displaying disk free space in a human-readable format (`disk-free-human.sh`), preserving root environment variables, and managing Allemande home directory detection.  Also created an 'qos' alias for `quiet-on-success`.
*   **Code Generation:** Improved `gent.sh` to handle shell scripts correctly and create symlinks to BATS test helpers.
*   **File Comparison:** Added `vimdiff_tilde.sh` to compare files with their backups.
*	**Swapped parameters**: Fixed the target/source parameter order in the translate shell script, `translate.sh`
*   **Safety Rule**: Added a safety rule about using mktemp for temp files to the shell guide, `guidance-sh.md`
*	**General Utilities**: Added `pipechat` and `iochat` for bidir pipe and tty communication, added `uniqo.pl` to remove duplicate lines, fixed bats helper symlink timing.
*	**Mount point**: Auto-detect the mount point for rubbish bins, instead of only using `$HOME/.rubbish`.

### Game Development Started

The initial steps were taken in exploring game development with Pygame.

*   **Game Engine Boilerplate:** Created a basic game engine (`boiler.py`) with common functionality for Pygame projects.  This includes handling events, drawing objects, playing sound, and managing game state.
*   **Example Game:** Created an example game, "Move the Square!" (`game1.py`), using the simplified framework.  The game features keyboard controls, boundary collision, and sound effects. The files `game1a.py` and `game1b.py` were moved to a sub directory, `old/`.
*	**Mouse dragging**: Added mouse dragging functionality for game objects.
*	**Music**: Music can now be played in the new game engine.
*	**Australian Curriculum project**: Australian Curriculum related project scripts were created.

### Ally Chat PWA and Notification Work

Preliminary work was done to convert Ally Chat into a Progressive Web App (PWA) and add push notification support.

*   **Manifest and Service Worker:** Added a service worker (`service-worker.js`) for offline mode and push notifications, along with a PWA manifest (`manifest.json`). This is a **work in progress**, and the functionality is currently disabled due to issues with testing and initial implementation.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Added a "notify" button (currently disabled) to request notification permissions.
*	**PWA disabled**: The code was updated to remove broken service worker and PWA functionality.

### Ally Portals Improvements

*	**`ALLEMANDE_PORTS` environment variable renamed**: Renamed to `ALLEMANDE_PORTALS` and code updated to comply. This was done in a commit that also moved the `ports.py` module to `ally/portals.py` and renamed the class and functions inside.
*   **Portals client code**: The code has been improved and cleaned up for better maintainability. The code for mounting portals has been extracted into functions in `ally_mount.sh`.

## Challenges Faced:

*   **Balancing Features:** Managing the scope of work across LLM integration, utility scripts, and new areas like game development required careful prioritization.
*   **Service worker**: Several bugs exist in the service worker implementation. Testing and refactoring is required to resolve the issues.
*   **Building**: Multiple issues occured when trying to install different AI frameworks.

That's a long week of effort!
