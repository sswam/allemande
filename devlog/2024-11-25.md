# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-25 to 2024-12-01

This week has been very productive, with progress on Ally Chat, new utility scripts, and continued work on game development. I've focused on improving existing features and laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Ally Chat Refinements:** Enhanced Claude integration, improved webchat keyboard handling, streamlined welcome text, and experimented with PWA functionality.
*   **Improved Speech Synthesis:** Fixed parler-tts model versioning, added support for different sdk versions, and defaulted to the "mini" model for faster compilation.
*   **New Game Development:** Expanded the game development effort with more projects and improved code organization.
*   **Utility Scripting:** Added command execution on file change and note-taking improvements.
*   **OpenAPI Processing:** Added new functionality for processing and optimizing OpenAPI documentation, specifically for LLMs.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Ally Chat Refinements

Ally Chat received several updates this week, focused on improving the user experience and backend functionality.

*   **Claude Enhancements:** Added special system messages for Claude to improve its behavior and ensure it replies as itself without prefixes. Agent system messages and regex matching were improved for better LLM response handling.
*   **Webchat Keyboard Handling:** Improved keyboard event handling between the chat frames for a more seamless user experience.
*   **Streamlined User Welcome:** Simplified the webchat's new user welcome text for clarity.
*   **Toggle Room Functionality**: Added toggle to return to main from user's room if clicked again.
*   **Attempted PWA and Service Worker Integration**: Initial steps taken to turn Ally Chat into a Progressive Web App and add push notification support, including service worker implementation. CORS debugging documentation was also added.

### Improved Speech Synthesis

Significant progress was made on the text-to-speech capabilities, focusing on the Parler-TTS model.

*   **Parler-TTS Fixes:** Fixed parler-tts model versioning and pinned the version to ensure compatibility with the `large-v1` model. Added support for sdk 1.1 models using separate tokenizers and defaulted to the mini model for faster compilation.

### New Game Development

I continued exploring game development, focusing on creating simple educational games.

*   **Game Development Projects**: Expanded the number of games and game-related scripts. Implemented the ability to zoom a Sierpinski gasket and allow for scribbling.

### Utility Scripting

Enhancements to utility scripts include adding ability to run commands on file changes.

*   **File Change Watcher:** Implemented `awatch` to run commands or services automatically when files change, useful for tasks such as automatically rebuilding code.
*   **Notebook Kernel**: Improved AST to detect statements vs expressions for proper REPL behavior.
*   **Automatic Note Selection:** Enabled automatic note file selection based on the current task or defaulting to "note" in the `plan` tool.

### OpenAPI Processing

A new tool was added to process OpenAPI documentation for LLMs.

*   **OpenAPI Doc Condenser:** Created a tool to condense OpenAPI documentation into markdown format, making it more suitable for consumption by LLMs.

## Challenges Faced:

*   **Service Worker Implementation**: PWA and service worker integration proved challenging, with ongoing issues requiring more testing and refactoring.
