# Devlog: Week of 2024-12-02 to 2024-12-08

This week has been intensely focused on refining Ally Chat, integrating new services, and improving overall system architecture. The major themes were file handling, enhanced AI model integration, and administration improvements.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Ally Chat File Upload and Display:** Implemented file upload functionality in Ally Chat, with automatic media type detection and appropriate Markdown/HTML insertion (images, audio, video, and generic links) for display. This includes handling file naming collisions and video compatibility checks.
*   **Admin Improvements:** Enhanced admin scripts for user and portal management, including support for multiple clients, portal mounts, and improved help messages.
*   **Enhanced AI Model Integration:** Improved handling of AI model outputs, including smarter stop regex, configurable stop patterns in requests, more chaotic llama model output, and checkpoint selection for A1111.
*   **Core Refactoring and Improvements:** Replaced the external `slugify` package with a custom implementation, improved streaming code with context managers and queues, and added an image generation service for A1111.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Ally Chat File Handling

The biggest feature this week was file upload in Ally Chat.

*   **File Upload Implementation:** Users can now upload files, which are saved with unique names and appropriate markdown inserted into the chat. The file type (image, audio, video, or generic) is automatically detected and handled correctly, with direct image viewing upon click.
*   **Video Compatibility:** Added video format checking and a recoding tool to ensure uploaded videos are web-compatible, automatically converting where necessary.

### Admin Improvements

Significant work was done to improve the admin experience and how multiple instances of the system are managed.

*   **Portal Management:** The "ports" directory has been renamed to "portals" for clarity, and the `allemande_install.sh` script was improved. It now includes hostname disambiguation in user directory paths to avoid naming collisions between machines.
*   **Multi-Client Support:** Portal mounts and user setup now support multiple clients. Remote hostnames are read from config. Also local machine shares can be skipped during mounting/unmounting.
*   **Script Enhancements:** The `allemande_user_add.sh` script now includes a help option for easier usage.

### Enhanced AI Model Integration

Integration with various AI models has been significantly improved.

*   **Improved Stop Regex:** Smarter stop regex have been implemented for local agent responses, enabling agents to use their own `name:` prefixes. These regexes are now configurable within requests.
*   **Chaotic Llama Output:** The Llama model's output has been made more chaotic by adjusting temperature, repetition penalty, and penalty alpha, as well as disabling top-k sampling. Pure top-p sampling is now used.
*   **A1111 Integration:** Implemented model checkpoint selection and non-boolean pony prompt weight in image generation with A1111. Also added limit on number of adetailer matches to redraw, and the mask k-largest option to adetailer config.

### Core Refactoring and Improvements

Several core components have been refactored and improved for better performance and maintainability.

*   **Slug Implementation:** Replaced the `slugify` package with a custom slug implementation for better control and reduced dependencies.
*   **Async Streaming:** The streaming code has been refactored using context managers and queues for better resource management and error handling in `AsyncTail` and `AsyncKeepAlive`.
*   **Image Generation Service:** Added an image generation service for the A1111 API, allowing image generation requests to be served from a portals directory.
*   **Asyncio Migration**: Replaced sleep calls with `asyncio.sleep()` in image_a1111 service for asynchronicity.

## Challenges Faced:

*   Refactoring streaming code was a nightmare, likely due to the complexities of asynchronous operations and resource management.
