# Devlog: Week of 2024-12-09 to 2024-12-15

This week's focus was on enhancing Ally Chat's functionality and user experience, with additions ranging from a new game to improved chat management and some under-the-hood tweaks.

## Key Achievements:

*   **New Game: Rockfall!** A Boulder Dash-style puzzle platformer has been added, offering a fun distraction and showcasing the platform's capabilities.
*   **Enhanced Chat Management:** Users can now undo the last message or archive a chat room, providing better control over content.
*   **Web Chat UI Improvements:** Several improvements were made to the web chat interface, including a reorganized control panel, fixes for video recording, and better YouTube embed layout.
*   **LLM Parameter Tuning:** The generation parameters for the Llama LLM were tweaked, resulting in better response quality.
*   **Simplified JavaScript "Hello World":** The example JavaScript module was simplified and made more portable.
*   **Under-the-hood work:** Improved processing of line buffers, disabled demo cronjobs, enabled multiple reference files in LLM prompting tools.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Rockfall: A New Puzzle Game

This week saw the addition of "Rockfall," a new game inspired by Boulder Dash. In this puzzle platformer, players must collect diamonds and reach the exit while avoiding falling rocks.  Rocks can be pushed horizontally and will slide left/right when blocked. This addition expands the platform's functionality beyond just chat and demonstrates its ability to integrate interactive experiences.

### Chat Management: Undo and Archive

The chat interface gained some important new features for managing content. Users can now "undo" their last message, removing it from the room.  Additionally, an "archive" function was added, allowing admins to save the contents of a room before clearing it. These changes provide increased control over chat content.

### Web Chat UI Improvements

Several user interface improvements were implemented in the web chat client.

*   **Control Panel Reorganization:** The input controls were reorganized into main, add, and edit button groups for a cleaner and more intuitive interface.
*   **Video Recording Fixes:** Issues with video recording controls were resolved.
*   **YouTube Embed Layout:** The layout of YouTube video embeds was improved, ensuring thumbnails maintain a fixed aspect ratio and margins are correct. The flash() animation was also fixed to target the correct element. The timer now uses an HTML `div` instead of a text input.

### LLM Parameter Tuning

The generation parameters for the Llama LLM were tuned.  This involved dropping `penalty_alpha`, tweaking the `penalty` and `temperature` values, and enabling top-k/p sampling. The changes reportedly improved response quality, following Claude's advice for good parameters.

### Simplified JavaScript Example

The example JavaScript module, `hello_js.js`, was simplified. Unnecessary `try/catch` wrappers and error handlers were removed, and the module detection logic was improved to work correctly in both Node.js and Deno. The AI notes were moved to `guidance-js.md`.

### Additional Changes

*   A third suffix (`p3`) was added to the `buflines.py` script, allowing for more flexible formatting of grouped lines.
*   Cron jobs and demo rooms were disabled in the administrative scripts.
*   The `query.sh` and `que.sh` scripts for querying LLMs now support multiple reference files, enhancing the prompting tools.
*   The chat client now correctly handles user names in chat messages with whitespace before/after the name. The file clearing mechanism in rooms was simplified to use `unlink` instead of truncating the file.

## Bug Fixes

This week addressed a couple of key bugs:
*   The chat client now correctly handles user names in chat messages with whitespace before/after the name.
*   The `flash()` function was fixed to target the correct element, and an issue with missing rotation confirm message was resolved.
