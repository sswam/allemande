# Devlog: Week of 2024-12-16 to 2024-12-22

This week saw a continued push to enhance Ally Chat with new features, improve existing tools, and address some minor housekeeping items. A significant focus was on improving chat functionality, image generation capabilities, and adding web push notifications.  I was off work for a couple weeks prior, getting ready for the holidays.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Chat Initiative:** Implemented a scheduled chat prompting system, enabling AI agents to proactively engage with users.
*   **Web Push Notifications:** Added support for web push notifications, allowing users to receive real-time updates on chat activity.
*   **Anime Image Generation:** Integrated a new anime-style NSFW image generation model.
*   **Improved File Watching:** Enhanced `atail` to be more robust, with options for restarting and using polling instead of inotify.
*   **General improvements:** Added a new thread-safe dictionary, various CLI tools, and multiple minor changes.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Chat Initiative: Proactive AI Engagement

A key feature added this week is the "chat initiative" system. This system allows an AI agent to be prompted to talk to a user in a chat room at scheduled intervals. A new script, `initiative.py`, was created to handle this, leveraging cronjobs for scheduling.  The script includes features like:

*   Randomized wait periods to avoid predictable prompts.
*   Checks to ensure the agent and user haven't been chatting too recently.
*   A configurable "repeat" interval to prevent repeated prompts if the user doesn't respond.
*   A `--no-act` flag for testing without actually writing to the chat room.
*   Customizable system messages.

A companion shell script, `open_chat_on_system_message.sh`, was also updated to automatically open the chat in a browser window when a system message (indicating an AI initiative) is detected.  This script now uses the enhanced `atail` command.

### Web Push Notifications: Real-time Chat Updates

Web push notifications were implemented, allowing users to receive real-time updates from Ally Chat. This involved several steps:

*   Added necessary packages (`py-vapid`, `pywebpush`) to `requirements.txt` and `requirements-webchat.txt`.
*   Created a `config.js.dist` file with configuration variables, including URLs and the VAPID public key for push notifications.
*   Added a `/x/subscribe` endpoint to the web chat API (`chat-api.py`) to handle subscription requests.
*   Implemented JavaScript code (`webchat/static/notify.js`) to handle notification permissions and subscription.
*   Updated the service worker (`webchat/static/service_worker.js`) to handle push events and notification clicks.
*   Modified `webchat/static/index.html` to include the necessary scripts and a "notify" button.

The implementation includes TODO notes for future enhancements, such as storing subscription data in user settings files and implementing logic to trigger notifications based on various chat events.

### Anime Image Generation: Expanding AI Art Capabilities

A new image generation model, "Poni," was added to Ally Chat. This model is designed to generate anime-style NSFW images.  The `AGENTS_LOCAL` dictionary in `ally_chat.py` was updated to include the Poni agent, along with its configuration settings.

### Improved File Watching with `atail`: Robust Log Monitoring

The `atail` utility was significantly improved to be more robust and versatile.  New features include:

*   A polling mode as an alternative to inotify, useful for systems where inotify is not available or reliable.
*   A "restart" option that keeps following the file even if it's removed and recreated.

These enhancements make `atail` more reliable for monitoring log files and other dynamic content. These options are now used to reliably follow logs on the server without dropping events.

### Other Changes and Improvements:

*   **Thread-Safe Dictionary:** A thread-safe dictionary (`ThreadSafeDict`) was implemented in Python, using a mutex lock to protect against race conditions.  A test script (`test_thread_safe_dict.py`) was added to verify its functionality. Returns copies of dict items when iterating to prevent lock contention.
*   **New Text Editor Tool:** Created a new command line tool, `ted.pl`, which applies Perl code snippets to stdin and outputs the result to stdout.
*   **Hello World Templates:** The `vi_execute.sh` script was updated to use templates for creating new C, C++, and Python files, instead of copying existing "hello world" files.
*   **Disk Space Display:** The `disk-free-human.sh` script was modified to shorten "Mounted on" to "Mount" in the output, improving compactness.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The setup of `config.sh` was changed from a symlink to a file copy, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential issues with symbolic links.  A fallback was added to the config file to use the current user if the USER variable is not set.
*   **Path Uniqueness:** The `path_uniq.sh` script was updated to filter out empty paths from path variables.
*   **Obsolete Code Removal:**  Cleaned up obsolete and test code in `chat.py` and `webchat/static/chat.js`.
*   **Minor Fixes:** Improved logging code in the `slug.py` tool and handled missing room files in the initiative script. Also added an exit message to the root logger via `atexit`, and ignored webchat config js files.
*   **Storage Speed Test:** Added the `storage_speed_test.sh` script to test disk speed for all mounted devices.
*   **glxgears:** Made the glxgears file not executable.
*   **Redundant Markdown Section Removed:** The redundant "Conclusion" section was deleted from `hello_md.md`.
*   **Chat Method to Get Last N Messages:** A method to get the last n messages from a chat room was added.
*   **Removed Rotate Button:** Removed the rotate button from the web chat UI.
