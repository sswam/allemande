# Devlog: Week of 2024-12-23 to 2024-12-29

This week was productive, with improvements across several areas of Ally Chat. The focus was on enhancing the user interface, improving AI agent interactions, adding features, and making some under-the-hood adjustments.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Improved Web Chat Recording UI:** Streamlined the audio/video recording UI in the web chat, making it more intuitive.
*   **Enhanced AI Agent Name Recognition:** Improved the accuracy of agent name recognition in chat messages, ensuring proper triggering of agent responses.
*   **Comments in A1111 Prompts:**  Added support for comments within prompts used by the A1111 image generation client, allowing for better organization and experimentation with prompts.
*   **Enhanced `atail` Restart Logic:** Fixed a bug in the `atail` utility's restart logic, ensuring reliable log monitoring even when files are removed and recreated.
*   **Added ideas on LLM Self-Control:** Added a new note with ideas on LLM self-control via parameter adjustments.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Web Chat Recording UI Improvements

The web chat's recording interface received a significant usability update. The changes include:

*   The "cancel" buttons in the recording interface now display "back".
*   The dedicated "pause" button was removed and its functionality was merged into the timer button. Clicking the timer now toggles between pause and resume.
*   CSS styles were updated to ensure button styles are consistently applied.

These changes make the recording process more streamlined and intuitive for users.

### Improved AI Agent Name Recognition

The logic for identifying agent names within chat messages was enhanced. The improved name recognition aims to ensure that AI agents are reliably triggered when their names are mentioned in a conversation. This was achieved by:

*   Prioritizing matches where the agent's name appears at the start or end of a message.
*   Considering cases where the agent's name is followed by a comma.
*   Changing the logging level from DEBUG to INFO to reduce the amount of chat spam.

### A1111 Prompt Comments

To improve the organization and readability of A1111 image generation prompts, a feature was added to allow comments within the prompt strings. The client removes comments from prompts before using them for image generation.

### `atail` Restart Logic Fix

A bug was identified and fixed in the `atail` utility's restart logic. `atail` is used to follow the output of log files, and the "restart" option makes it continue following the file even if the file is removed and recreated. The fix ensures that `atail` reliably resumes following the file in such scenarios.

### Other Changes and Additions:

*   **LLM Self-Control:** Added a new note with ideas on LLM self-control via parameter adjustments, including the idea to have the LLM emit tokens to adjust its own parameters such as temperature.
*   **Apocryphal Text Summary:** A summary of *The Story of Melchizedek*, an apocryphal text, was added to the `gen` directory.
*   **Makefile Update:** The hardcoded log path in the Makefile was replaced with a variable, improving flexibility and maintainability.
