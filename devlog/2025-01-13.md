# Devlog: Week of 2025-01-13 to 2025-01-19

This week was about enhancing the Ally Chat user experience, particularly around image generation and handling, as well as adding a new tool for file recovery.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Improved Image Generation:** Increased image generation timeout and enabled high-resolution upscaling. Added two new image models: Coni and Boni.
*   **Enhanced Image Handling:** Made images and other media larger and more interactive.
*   **New File Recovery Tool:** Introduced a command-line tool for recovering non-zero data blocks from files.
*   **Improved New User Experience:** Clarified new user instructions.
*   **Tweaked LLM Configuration:** Adjusted top\_p and top\_k values.
*   **Improved dimension documentation:** Updated image size documentation with commands

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Image Generation Improvements

I've been focusing on improving our AI image generation capabilities within Ally Chat. First, I increased the image generation timeout from 90 seconds to a more generous 3 minutes. This should prevent timeouts for more complex image requests. I also enabled the "hi-res fix" feature, scaling images up to 150% during generation for improved detail. Finally, I added two new image models, "Coni" and "Boni", to provide users with even more creative options.

### Enhanced Image Handling

To improve the display of images and other media within chat messages, I've increased the maximum width and height from 75% to 90% of the viewport. This makes the media larger and more visually appealing. Additionally, I've added click handling to images, so users can now open the image in a new tab or window. Shift-click opens in the current window, while ctrl-click (or middle-click) opens in a new tab, providing users with more control over how they view and interact with images.

### New File Recovery Tool

I created a new command-line tool called `recover_non_zero`. This tool reads data from standard input, block by block, and saves any non-zero blocks to sequentially numbered files. The block size is configurable via the `-b` or `--block-size` option, defaulting to 512 bytes. This tool can be useful for recovering data from corrupted files or storage devices, and I'm sure our users will find clever ways to utilize it.

### Improved New User Experience

I've updated the new account message displayed to new users with clearer instructions on how to get started with Ally Chat. The login details are now formatted for better readability. Also clarified information about room privacy, AI interaction, and added a note about the "poke" feature and main image model.

### Tweaked LLM Configuration

I've adjusted the `top_p` and `top_k` values in the Llama LLM configuration. These settings control the diversity and randomness of the generated text. I bumped these to 100 and 1000 respectively, to try and reduce the chance of bland output. It's a bit of a black art, but hopefully, these changes will lead to more interesting and creative AI responses.

### Image Dimension documentation

I improved the documentation describing the supported image dimensions, adding the commands you would type into the chat to select the relevant width and height.
