# Devlog: Week of 2025-01-20 to 2025-01-26

This week was focused on improving the quality of life in Ally Chat through a variety of small enhancements and bug fixes.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Image Generation Improvements:** Extended image generation timeout and added NSFW adetailers.
*   **Conductor Enhancement:** Prevented the conductor from misinterpreting "System" as a chat participant.
*   **Documentation Fix:** Corrected and improved the image dimension documentation.
*   **Shell Script Enhancement:** Added a fallback for the `mp` command in `see.sh`.
*   **Data Processing Fix:** Resolved an issue in `tsv2txt` related to string length calculation.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Image Generation Improvements

I've continued to refine the image generation capabilities. I increased the timeout for image generation to 5 minutes to avoid issues with more complex prompts or slower servers. Also, for those who are interested, I added some NSFW adetailers for the "Illy" model, giving it the ability to generate breasts and pussies with greater precision.

### Conductor Enhancement

A small but important fix was made to the conductor. The conductor is responsible for managing AI responses in group chats, figuring out who is talking to whom. Previously, the conductor could mistakenly identify "System" as a participant if the word appeared in the chat, leading to incorrect behavior. I've added "System" to an exclusion list, preventing this from happening.

### Documentation Fix

I've corrected an error in the `sdxl-dimensions.txt` documentation. The command format for setting image dimensions was incorrect ("set" instead of "sets"), and I fixed it. Also, to make it easier to copy and paste, I put all the valid `sets width=... height=...` commands onto a single line.

### Shell Script Enhancement

I made a small improvement to the `see.sh` script, which is a tool for quickly viewing different file types. I added a wrapper function `mp()` that first tries to use the `mp` command (if it exists), falling back to `mpv` if `mp` is not found. This provides a convenient fallback for users who might have one or the other installed.

### Data Processing Fix

I found a bug in the `tsv2txt` tool, which is used for converting TSV files to plain text. The tool was incorrectly calculating string lengths, which could lead to formatting issues. I fixed this by using the `utf8.RuneCountInString` function, which correctly handles UTF-8 encoded strings.
