# Devlog: Week of 2025-01-27 to 2025-02-02

After taking a week off to recharge, I jumped back into Ally Chat development with a focus on improving agent behavior, image generation, and chat interactions. This week saw enhancements to agent personalities, the addition of new agents, and improvements to the conductor's ability to manage conversations.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Improved Image Generation:** Added JPEG conversion support for images, and fixed some syntax errors in ComfyUI metadata processing.
*   **Agent Enhancements:** Adjusted character descriptions for existing agents and added a new agent, Emmie.
*   **Conductor Improvements:** Enhanced the conductor's ability to identify chat participants, including support for addressing "everyone" or "anyone".
*   **Agent Configuration:** Created base config files for portal, programming, and remote agents, streamlining agent setup.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Image Generation Improvements

I've continued to work on the image generation pipeline. A key addition this week was the ability to convert generated images to JPEG format. This is configurable per-agent, and helps reduce file sizes without a huge loss of quality, especially for images destined for web display. I also fixed a syntax error in the image processing code that was causing problems when splitting ComfyUI metadata lines. This ensures that all the image metadata is correctly parsed.

### Agent Enhancements

I've been focusing on making the AI agents feel more distinct and responsive. I've tweaked the character descriptions for agents like Ally, Barbie, and Callam, giving them more specific backstories and personalities. For example, Ally is now described as Asian / European, with long wavy blonde hair and brown eyes. These small details help the LLMs generate more consistent and engaging responses. I also added a new agent, Emmie, based on the GPT-4 model, expanding the range of AI personalities available. To improve the conversational flow, I added the ability for agents to respond in turns when multiple agents are inclined to reply, with a skip counter to handle multiple agent responses cleanly.

### Conductor Improvements

The conductor, which manages AI responses in multi-agent chats, has received some significant updates. It can now correctly identify names at the start of any line in the chat text, not just at the beginning of the message. This makes it more robust in complex conversations. I've also added support for addressing "everyone" or "anyone" in a chat. When a user addresses "everyone," the conductor can now randomly select agents (excluding the user) to respond. This allows for more dynamic and engaging group chat experiences.

### Agent Configuration

To streamline the process of adding and configuring agents, I've created a set of base configuration files for different agent types: portal agents (Llama LLM characters and Stable Diffusion configs), programming agents (with executors for Python, Node, Lua, Ruby, and other languages), and remote agents (like Claude and GPT-4). These configuration files provide a starting point for new agents and make it easier to manage agent settings.

I've also made some notes on the TODO list about things like adding keys as agent names, and thinking more carefully about the context limits for remote models. Need to decide soon where to store config, whether on each host or on a central server.
