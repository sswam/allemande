# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-03 to 2025-02-09

This week focused on agent improvements, chat enhancements, and some critical bug fixes. Several new agents were added, and significant refactoring was done to improve code quality and maintainability. I spent some time on image generation, fixing bugs and adding features.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Enhancements:** Added several new LLM agents with distinct personalities, improved agent handling code, and enhanced multi-agent conversation management.
*   **Chat Improvements:** Implemented tab key support in the chat interface, fixed room number assignment issues, and improved keyboard shortcuts. Also added functionality to compact text files by merging image lines.
*   **Image Generation Improvements:** Added a retry button to the webchat interface, increased the size of images displayed in chat, implemented HQ macro processing for Stable Diffusion, and fixed errors in PNG-to-JPEG conversion.
*   **Codebase Improvements:** Added type annotations for better type checking and refactored code for cleaner agent handling and request processing.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent Enhancements

I've added several new LLM agents this week, including Dali, Cloe, and Summar, each with unique personalities.  The Summar agent is particularly interesting, as it specializes in writing comprehensive summaries of the entire chat history, which is a valuable tool for long conversations.  I also improved prompts and handling of existing bot personalities and refactored the agent handling code for better maintainability and readability, including function docstrings. To improve the conversational flow, I added the ability for agents to respond in turns when multiple agents are inclined to reply, with a skip counter to handle multiple agent responses cleanly.

The conductor also received some upgrades to improve its ability to manage multi-agent conversations. I made it possible for multiple mentioned agents to reply to a message, using an "everyone" or "anyone" functionality to trigger responses from multiple agents. I've also addressed issues with properly stripping `@` symbols from agent names when parsing mentions.

### Chat Improvements

I made a number of user interface improvements to the chat platform. The most notable is the addition of tab key support within the textarea, which is especially useful for coding scenarios within the chat. I also fixed a bug in room number assignments and improved keyboard shortcuts for common actions like undo (now Alt-Z).

Also, I've added a new script to compact text files by merging image lines.

### Image Generation Improvements

This week brought improvements to image generation, mainly focused on the a1111 service and webchat interface. I reduced the output filename length limit to 70 characters to prevent issues with long filenames. A new "retry" button was added to the webchat interface, combining the "undo" and "send" functionalities for easier error recovery. I increased the maximum image display size to occupy up to 90% of the viewport for a better viewing experience.

The a1111 service was enhanced with HQ macro processing, enabling dynamic adjustments to image generation quality based on macro settings within the prompt. I addressed some errors in the PNG-to-JPEG conversion process, ensuring that temporary files are cleaned up properly and that non-UTF-8 metadata is handled gracefully. Also fixed a bug preventing certain file paths from being parsed as options. The a1111 service now retries on failure (after a 1-second delay), which should improve reliability.

### Codebase Improvements

To improve code quality and maintainability, I've added type annotations using the `types` packages (types-regex, types-Markdown, types-aiofiles) for better static type checking with MyPy.

## Other

I also worked on VPN configuration, renaming `netns_up.sh` to `netns-up.sh` and adding VPN wrapper tools.

Finally, the default models for the LLM service were changed to `claude` and `gpt-4o-mini`.
