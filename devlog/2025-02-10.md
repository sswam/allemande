# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-10 to 2025-02-16

This week saw a flurry of activity across multiple areas, including chat functionality, agent configuration, image generation, and codebase improvements. I added several new features to enhance the user experience and made significant progress towards better code organization and maintainability.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Chat Functionality:** Added new AI characters, improved content filtering, implemented alternating context for more natural conversations, and enhanced file handling in chat rooms. A text editor view was integrated into webchat along with handy shortcuts and file-type specific display.
*   **Agent Enhancements:** Introduced remote AI agent configuration files for various LLMs and programming language execution configs.
*   **Image Generation Improvements:** Improved image generation including seed saving, improved polling for faster updates, and prompt formatting.
*   **Core System Enhancements:** Implemented pulse audio output switching, added tools for resource monitoring on Linux systems, integrated citation support for Perplexity API responses, and content safety filtering.
*   **File Handling and Security:** Implemented safer file operations with quote safety and case-insensitive filename matching.
*   **Codebase Improvements:** Continued refactoring to improve code quality, added type annotations, and improved test generator.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Chat Functionality

Two new AI characters, Akane and Nixie, were added with specific personalities and styles. Content filtering has been improved to more effectively manage chat content. I've also introduced alternating context for LLM agents, enabling more natural back-and-forth conversations, particularly with agents like Perplexity's Sonar models. Several new agents have been configured to utilize the new alternating context system.

File handling has been improved to allow file serving and editing directly within the chat interface. The UI now smartly detects file types and offers intelligent editor behavior depending on the file extension. Room clearing now creates empty files instead of leaving them nonexistent. Further improvements to the chat interface include message counters and more informative directory listings.

### Agent Enhancements

I've added several configuration files for remote AI agents, including Claude, Clia, Dav, and Emmy, and also introduced configs for programming language execution. This allows easy integration of remote LLMs and execution sandboxes into the chat platform. I've also added dynamic module reloading for agent configs, which allows live updating of agent definitions. A "service" key has been added to all agent configs to improve clarity. Added an `adult` flag to the agent configs to allow filtering explicit content.

### Image Generation Improvements

This week's changes to image generation included saving the seed for each generated image, which is now available in the result.yaml file for traceability and reproducibility. To improve responsiveness, the polling interval for image generation requests has been reduced from 1 second to 0.1 seconds. Also, the way the prompt is split into a "positive" and "negative" prompt has been changed from `--` to `NEGATIVE`.

### Core System Enhancements

Added support for switching PulseAudio outputs using a Python script and shell alias. New tools were added to monitor resource-intensive processes on Linux. The Perplexity API responses now include citation support for enhanced information accuracy. An adult content filtering system was added to improve platform safety. This week also saw the addition of brace and bracket pair matching validation in code.

### File Handling and Security

Implemented quote safety in file operations, preventing filenames with leading dashes from being parsed as options. The system also now supports case-insensitive file extension matching, improving file handling flexibility.

### Codebase Improvements

I continued code refactoring to improve overall code quality and organization. Type annotations are being added for improved type checking. The test generator tool has been enhanced with function subset testing, allowing tests to be created only for specified functions within a file.

### Nginx

I've also configured an Nginx CORS header to allow `chat.allemande.ai` to access the resources hosted under the webchat server.

### Other

There were also minor fixes and improvements, such as adding a state file for pulse audio toggle, and adding character descriptions.
