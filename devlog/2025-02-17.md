# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-17 to 2025-02-23

This week involved significant progress in improving the Allemande platform, particularly focusing on enhancing chat functionality, managing AI agents, and streamlining various internal tools. Key areas of work included improvements to the webchat interface, refactoring existing code for better maintainability, and adding new features to improve the user experience.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Webchat Enhancements**: I made several enhancements to the webchat interface. This includes adding cross-origin policy headers, fixing dependency issues related to D3 and Graphviz, improving error logging in BB-to-HTML conversion, and adding custom HTML insertions.
*   **Agent Management**: I added and refactored AI agent configurations and updated the agent system to be config-based and dynamic. Visual prompts and better prompt-building tips have been added to improve the quality of image generation.
*   **Text Processing**: The 'aligno' text alignment tool was translated from Python to Go, and improvements to text processing and encoding were made.
*   **File Handling and Deduplication**: A new file deduplication tool with linking options was implemented, and YAML body read/write support was added.
*    **Search and APIs**: A google search API was added.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Webchat Enhancements
To improve the webchat interface and address security concerns, I added a cross-origin policy header for rooms.allemande.ai. Dependency issues between D3 and Graphviz were resolved by swapping D3 versions and fixing Graphviz setup for rendering. Additionally, I implemented enhancements to header templates and added anti-cache parameters for file fetches. Error logging in BB-to-HTML conversion was improved for better debugging. Custom `<head>` and `<body>` insertions were added to room HTML streams for greater flexibility.

### Agent Management
Significant refactoring of the agent system was undertaken, moving agent configuration to YAML files and replacing the old hard-coded lists. This allows for more dynamic and maintainable agent definitions. I also adjusted theme files and made various UI improvements. A new `room-archive` script was created. The service field was renamed to `type` across agents. The `agents` folder was moved to the root directory, and agent configurations were replaced in chat to improve maintainability. Default context and model usage were optimized to lower costs and increase efficiency.

### Text Processing
A new file deduplication tool with linking options was added to streamline storage and improve code quality. A comprehensive text alignment tool, 'aligno', was created by translating it from Python to Go. Code quality was enhanced, and UTF-8 encoding support was added to existing text processing scripts. This week also included adding CFLAGS and LDFLAGS support to C linting and the simplification of C linting in general.

### File Handling and Deduplication
The `room-archive` script was updated to use numbered room suffixes instead of dates for better organization. New support for YAML+body hybrid file reading and writing was added, and existing file handling code was improved with more descriptive function names.

### Search and APIs
I implemented the Google Search and Images API clients via the Serper Dev API, giving the platform more powerful search capabilities. This also involved refactoring and modernizing search code, adding type hints, and generally making the search functionality more robust.

### Codebase Improvements
Significant work was done to clean and refactor code across the platform. This included modernizing search code, simplifying code extraction, adding type hints, and reformatting code indentation.

I also implemented an auto-apply changes option.
Also worked on improving test file paths.
Removed test code generation.

### Other
I fixed an issue with secrets, making the secrets.sh file optional, and improved test file paths. I also reduced logging noise by changing the info level to debug in the conductor.
The chat room guide was completed and added examples of special syntax.
Customizing the Illu persona was expanded by visual appearance settings.
I worked to ensure .bb files end with a double newline on save.
Also improved chat prompt cleaning.
Modified rooms-commit script to source Allemande Env.sh.

Finally, I did some fine tuning for Illu tips to better prompt-building. Also did some work to improve how the conductor is able to match names in chats.
The room-rotate script was renamed to room-archive and made it more descriptive.
Also made some adjustments to context parameters in the agents.
Some file caching improvements.
Also fixed some small logic issues related to visual prompt updates.
