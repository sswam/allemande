# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-24 to 2025-03-02

This week saw a flurry of activity centered around refining AI agent behavior, enhancing visual generation capabilities, and improving the overall user experience in Allemande. Key achievements include the introduction of new AI models, enhancements to agent personalities, the addition of shortcodes for more dynamic prompting, and various fixes and refinements to the webchat interface.

## Key Achievements:

*   **AI Model Expansion:** Added support for new AI models including Grok from xAI and Clauden utilizing the new Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic, providing users with a broader range of AI interaction options.
*   **Enhanced Visual Generation**: Improvements were made to agent configurations, particularly around visual descriptions, offering greater control over the appearance of AI-generated characters and images. This includes separating visual fields like clothes, age, and emotional state.
*   **Dynamic Prompting with Shortcodes:** New shortcodes were added to the Unprompted system. These additions enhance the flexibility and dynamic nature of prompt generation within Allemande, enabling random numbers, weighted choices, and conditional logic in prompts.
*   **Webchat Interface Refinements:** Several improvements and fixes were implemented in the webchat interface, addressing issues related to service workers, image handling, and keyboard navigation, leading to a smoother user experience.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### AI Model Expansion
The addition of Grok (xAI) and Clauden (Anthropic) models significantly expands Allemande's AI capabilities. A thinking flag was introduced to encourage LLMs to engage in analytical thinking, resulting in more insightful responses.

### Enhanced Visual Generation
Significant work was done to refactor the agent system, separating clothing, age, and emotional state into distinct visual fields in the agent configuration files. This allows for more granular control over the visual prompts used to generate AI images, resulting in more consistent and accurate character representations. The introduction of the `person` macro has been particularly effective for AI artist prompting. Furthermore, improved bust shot prompt templates are now used to generate better AI portraits. There were also some changes related to context windows.

### Dynamic Prompting with Shortcodes
The addition of random number, weight, and conditional shortcodes to the Unprompted system brings a new level of dynamic control to prompt generation. This allows for the creation of prompts that can vary based on random elements, weighted choices, or conditional logic, leading to more diverse and interesting AI responses.

### Webchat Interface Refinements
Multiple improvements were made to the webchat interface. This includes adding user scripts and improving image handling. There were also improvements to view options and the addition of image sizing classes. Also implemented were fixes for service workers. There were also some small adjustments made to message margins. The addition of keyboard room navigation using subfolders was also done this week.

### Miscellaneous Improvements
Several other smaller improvements and fixes were implemented across the platform, including adding chmod and remove methods to the FileCache class, extending the spool cleanup script to include additional directories, and refactoring code for better readability and maintainability. I've also included some new agents, and updated a lot of existing agent profiles. I also improved the system prompt for image generation. This included local target to make sure I didn't chmod local files.

### Documentation
Documentation was also updated, which split AI models by online/offline access for clarity. There were also updates to the AI model list in the intro documentation.

### Other Notes:

*   Continued code cleanup and refactoring to improve maintainability.
*   .yml files are now being named with CamelCase and lower case variants are deleted for consistency.
*   Addressed various small bugs and edge cases to enhance overall stability.
