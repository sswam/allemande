# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09

This week focused heavily on refining the AI agent system, improving visual generation, enhancing the user experience in Allemande's webchat, and some general script cleanup and documentation.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent System Refactoring and Expansion**: Significant refactoring of the agent system for better organization and maintainability. This included creating dedicated `Agent` and `Agents` classes. The loading, merging, and handling of agent configurations were substantially improved. Several new agents like Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Buffy, Willow, and Xena were added and existing agents like Illu, and other assistant agent personas were greatly improved.
*   **Enhanced Visual Generation Control:** Improvements made to agent configurations, particularly around visual descriptions and persona prompts, offering greater control over the appearance of AI-generated characters and images.
*   **Webchat Interface and Usability Improvements:** A rewrite of `webchat_user.sh` streamlined user management, added NSFW access control, and improved the overall user experience. Webchat also got various updates.
*   **Vision API Support**: Vision API support has been improved with added MIME type handling for images, and added descriptions and documentation.
*   **Scripting Improvements:** Refactored shell scripts for cleaner APIs and system prompt support.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent System Refactoring and Expansion

The agent system underwent a significant refactoring.  `Agent` and `Agents` classes were created to better organize agent data and logic. The base agent loading and merging logic was improved, also offering more robust validation. A better agent config merging and template var feature was also added. Agent name deduplication was implemented to ensure clean agent lists. The way agents are loaded, initialized, and removed has been refined, addressing edge cases. Agents got a lines parameter to keep them concise. There were also updates to the new agent descriptions. Some of the new agents included: Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Buffy, Willow, Xena, as well as a number of streamlined assistant agent personas, like Clu and Emm, based on Claude and Emmy respectively. Context window sizes have been adjusted, with most agents receiving an increase from 21 to 101 tokens.

### Enhanced Visual Generation Control

Agent configurations saw improvements, particularly around visual descriptions. Visual fields like clothes, age, and emotional state have been separated in the agent configuration files, giving more granular control over AI image prompts and leading to more consistent character representations. The image generation prompting for all characters has been improved.

### Webchat Interface and Usability Improvements

`webchat_user.sh` was rewritten, significantly improving user management. Getting started instructions for new users were added, along with NSFW access management and user directory creation with default themes. The code structure was improved, and shell scripting practices were standardized. Also improved was the user setting functionality. An option was added to skip scrolling to the bottom for new users.
Image history limit control was added to the chat UI, allowing users to manage their image history more effectively.
Keyboard navigation with subfolders was added.

### Vision API Support

Support for vision APIs has been significantly enhanced, enabling better image handling. The codebase now supports both OpenAI and Anthropic image formats, automatically resizing and formatting images based on vendor constraints. Base64 encoding, URL validation, and MIME type handling have also been improved.

### Scripting Improvements

Shell scripts were refactored for cleaner APIs and system prompt support. This includes improvements to argument handling, more consistent option naming, and clearer code structure. Added has been the abillity to have more clear and safer argument handling.

### Documentation

The intro documentation was updated to include key safety and help information and technical details, to include clear NSFW guidance, and help instructions with designated AI helpers.

### Miscellaneous Improvements

*   Added a recursive container balancing feature for i3 window sizes.
*   Fixed a race condition in `atail.py` related to file growth and seeking.
*   Improved handling of image limits, access checks, and `safe_join` within the chat system.
*   Improved disk space checks in system monitoring and fixed a typo.
*   Added a new script to format markdown tables.
*   .base files are now used for room templates instead of .template.
*   Improvements to Markdown and code block processing/rendering
*   Many fixes to agent system prompts.
*   Improved the way agents load system prompts
*   Various fixes related to context windows.
*   The ability to use a <think keep=1> tag to pass context into future prompts has been added.
