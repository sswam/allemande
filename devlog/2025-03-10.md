# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-10 to 2025-03-16

This week saw continued improvements across the Allemande platform, with a focus on agent enhancements, UI/UX refinements for webchat, and under-the-hood improvements to stability and code quality. There was a lot of work on smaller details, which, added up, make a big difference in the user experience.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Visual and Prompt Refinements**:  Further refined agent character visuals by improving clothing descriptions, fixing age settings, and standardizing system prompts.
*   **Webchat Enhancements**: Many new features and refinements in webchat including room renaming, code highlighting, better image handling and compact view.
*   **Infrastructure and Stability**:  Added error handling to file watching, fixed race conditions in file processing, and improved YAML formatting, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience.
*   **Documentation and Onboarding**: Continued to improve documentation, adding quick start guides and improving existing instructions.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent Visual and Prompt Refinements

The agent system continued to evolve this week. Visual descriptions have been improved, particularly the splitting of clothes into upper and lower body categories, allowing for more granular control over image generation. This leads to better-defined character representations.  Age settings have also been standardized across all agents, and some errors in descriptions have been fixed. The agent system got some more standardization, by standardizing system prompts across various agents for consistency. Agents such as Clauden, Claude, Clia, Clu and Vega all got standardized prompting. A number of agents (Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the Muppets) have been added.

### Webchat Enhancements

This week was packed with new features and improvements for the webchat interface. Key additions include:

*   **Room Management**: Users can now rename or move rooms and files using `Alt+M`.
*   **Code Highlighting**: Code blocks now feature syntax highlighting, making code snippets more readable.
*   **Compact View**: A new compact view mode was added to reduce UI size and improve mobile keyboard handling.
*   **Image Handling**: The display and layout of images have been improved, and a bug related to symlinks has been fixed. Image view modes have been improved and display controls have been added.
*   **Accessibility**: An "access denied" icon is displayed when room access is denied.
*   **General Polish**: Various styling and layout issues have been addressed for directory listings, image display, and layout consistency.
*   **Highlight Toggle**:Highlighing can now be toggled, rather than being permanently on.

Furthermore, CORS headers have been added for `rooms.allemande.ai` to the chat configuration. Work has also been done on adding light mode support for code blocks.

### Infrastructure and Stability

Several changes focused on improving the stability and reliability of the Allemande platform.

*   **Error Handling**: Error handling has been added around file watching, making file processing more robust. `awatch` now wraps filter and handler functions with error handling.
*   **File Processing**: A race condition in `bb2html` related to concurrent writes and file changes has been fixed.
*   **Dependency Management**: Upgraded from PyYAML to ruamel.yaml. CTranslate2 and whisperx requirements have been added. Also added has been pdfminer and optree. Also enabled CUDA for CTranslate2 install.
*   **Script Cleanup**: The script names for updating haproxy and nginx have been standardized.

### Documentation and Onboarding

Efforts continue to improve the documentation and onboarding experience for new users. Quick start guides have been added to the documentation, providing basic instructions for chat and image generation. New safety and help information has been added to the intro documentation.

### Miscellaneous

- A new script has been added to open xterms for Allemande services.
- A new script has been added to show git history with patches.
