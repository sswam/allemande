# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-17 to 2025-03-23

This week featured a strong focus on expanding AI art capabilities and improving the user experience around image generation, alongside general improvements to the Ally Chat platform.

## Key Achievements:

*   **AI Art Model Expansion**: Added several new AI art models (Hily, Dily, Wili), providing users with a wider range of artistic styles and capabilities. Agent configurations were created for these models.
*   **Regional Prompting**: Implemented regional prompting in the A1111 client, allowing for more complex and nuanced image generation.
*   **Agent Enhancements**: Continued refinements to agent visuals, prompt instructions, and configurations.
*   **Documentation**: Expanded documentation with guides for basic AI image generation, regional prompting, and structured LLM output.
*   **Chat Enhancements**:  Various improvements to the chat interface, including click-to-copy for code blocks and consistency fixes.
*   **Infrastructure and Stability**: Minor fixes and improvements to the core platform.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### AI Art Model Expansion

The platform now boasts even more options for AI art generation. This week saw the introduction of the Hily, Dily, and Wili AI art models. Hily is based on the LEOSAM's HelloWorld XL model and excels in fantasy and concept art. Dily uses the dreamshaperXL model and Wili uses the betterThanWords model, both SDXL-based.  These additions expand the stylistic range available to users. Configuration files have been set up for these new models. The Ally Chat welcome message was updated to include Hily in the list of AI art narrators.

### Regional Prompting

A significant feature addition this week is the implementation of regional prompting for the A1111 image generation client. This allows users to specify different prompts for different regions of the image, leading to more complex and controlled compositions.  The A1111 client now supports a number of parameters for regional prompting, including `rp_ratios`, `rp_base_ratios`, `rp_calc`, and `rp_flip`. The `regional` parameter activates regional prompting, specifying the mode (e.g., "columns", "rows"). There is new documentation detailing how to use regional prompting.

### Agent Enhancements

The agent system saw several improvements. A new agent, Gemmi, based on the Gemini 2.0 Pro model, was added. The Gemini 2.0 Pro model was also added to the list of available LLMs. The instructions given to the AI for creating distinct characters are improved. A bug was fixed which prevented agents from updating visuals when using local agents. Gemini 2.0 Pro replaced the Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental model in the Gemmi agent config. Agents such as Clu and Emm were configured to not be "welcoming" on start. A bug was fixed and a typo corrected in the Gemmy agent config. The agent configuration for Illu was refactored, clarifying the use of different AI artists and detailing LoRA selection. Sylvi, an existing agent, was accidentally set up as a symbolic link; this was fixed.

### Documentation

The documentation received several key updates. A new "basics.md" document provides an introduction to AI image generation and basic system features, complete with examples of advanced syntax including markdown, HTML, TeX math, Graphviz, and JavaScript. A guide to regional prompting has been added, explaining the structure, settings, and usage of this new feature. There is now a document explaining preferred structured LLM output, advocating for markdown over JSON in many cases.

### Chat Enhancements

Several refinements were made to the chat interface. Users can now copy code snippets to the clipboard by clicking the code title. Additionally, the CSS was modified to prevent the default font from overriding fonts specified within SVG elements. The image display settings were corrected, so that images now display correctly for new users.

### Infrastructure and Stability

Minor fixes and improvements were implemented. A bug was fixed in macro name parsing. A permission error is now properly caught in path validation. The `awatch` command now notices changes to symlinked files, such as agent configurations, by adding the `-L` flag. The Debian package list was updated to include `mecab` and `libmecab-dev`.

### Visual Styles

The platform now has an "anime3d" visual style that enhances anime-style image generation with a 3D effect. Negative prompts were added to both the "anime" and "photo" visual styles to improve image quality.

### Other changes

- Testy now has a debug flag.
- Photos of image models were added to the documentation, and also photos that were generated.
- Layout of cast diagrams were cleaned up, and photos were made collapsible.
- The order of agents was fixed in rooms to facilitate proper welcome messages.
