# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-24 to 2025-03-30

This week saw a lot of exciting updates to Ally Chat, with a heavy focus on improving image generation, chat functionality, and the overall user experience. We added support for Mermaid diagrams, enhanced AI agent personalities, and made several important fixes and refinements.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Mermaid Diagram Support**:  Added support for Mermaid diagrams in chat, allowing users to create and display flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more, right alongside Graphviz.
*   **AI Art Improvements**:  Expanded the range of available AI art models, made significant enhancements to regional prompting, and introduced prompt shortcuts for image dimensions and quality.
*   **Agent Personality Refinements**:  Made bot personas more nuanced and less overwhelming in initial interactions and added an age field to all agents.
*   **Chat Editing and Undo**:  Implemented message editing with meta commands, history editing functions, and soft undo functionality.
*   **DeepSeek Integration**: Added support for DeepSeek chat and reasoner models.
*   **UI/UX Improvements**: Increased the send button size for better touch targets, and made several other UI tweaks.
*   **Documentation Enhancements**:  Improved documentation with guides for quick start, image generation, and Mermaid diagrams.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Mermaid Diagram Support

A major feature addition this week is support for Mermaid diagrams. Users can now create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and other visualizations directly within the chat interface using Mermaid's markdown-inspired syntax.  This feature is enabled by including Mermaid's JavaScript library in the webchat and implementing a function to render Mermaid code blocks into SVG diagrams. Documentation was added to the basics and intro docs demonstrating how to use Mermaid diagrams, including how to properly quote labels with parentheses. The CSS rules for `.label` were improved to avoid targeting labels inside of Mermaid diagrams. The service worker cache was updated to include the mermaid lib.

### AI Art Improvements

The platform's AI art capabilities received several significant upgrades.

*   **New AI Art Models**:  We added several new AI art models: Broni, Chilli, Furii, Furri, Gilus, Ilus, and Pwny.
*   **Regional Prompting**: The regional prompter received several important improvements.  A threshold setting was added, and PAG integration was improved. We fixed an incompatibility between PAG and regional prompting prompt modes.
*   **Prompt Shortcuts**: Users can now use prompt shortcuts like `[L3]` to quickly set image dimensions and quality.  The shortcut system applies dimension presets for square, portrait, and landscape shapes, along with quality levels.

The maximum number of steps for image generation was limited to 150, and the maximum count was limited to 10.

### Agent Personality Refinements

We focused on making the AI agents more engaging and natural to interact with.

*   **More Reserved Initial Contact**: Bot personas are now more reserved in their initial contact, avoiding overwhelming new users with too much personality upfront. The personality description is now in double parens to separate it from behavior.
*   **Age Field**: An `age` field was added to all agents.
*   **Character Age Display**:  The `age` is now displayed dynamically in the chat.

We removed the Donald Trump and Elon Musk agents.

### Chat Editing and Undo

*   **Message Editing**: The chat now supports message editing with meta commands, allowing users to correct mistakes or refine their messages.
*   **History Editing**: History editing functions were added, including remove, insert, and edit capabilities.
*   **Soft Undo**: A soft undo function was implemented, providing an easy way to revert the last action. A confirmation dialog was added for undo actions, with a shift-key bypass.

### DeepSeek Integration

We added support for DeepSeek chat and reasoner models.

### UI/UX Improvements

*   **Send Button Size**: Increased the size of the send button to improve touch targets, especially on mobile devices.
*   **.access.yml**: Access list files were renamed from `access.yml` to `.access.yml` to hide them from casual browsing in room directories.
*   **Initial Setup**:  The initial setup for new NSFW users was fixed.
*   **.access.yml default**: A default access file is now created for new users' rooms when they sign up for NSFW access.

### Documentation Enhancements

*   **Quick Start Guides**: Improved the quick start guides for both SFW and NSFW users, providing clearer instructions on how to get started with the platform.
*   **Image Generation & Mermaid Docs**: Improved the clarity of the image generation and Mermaid documentation.

The documentation was updated to show proper styling of SVG diagrams from Graphviz and Mermaid. A note about uPlot's default x-axis behavior was also added.

### Other changes

*   Stop sequences were added to LLMs to prevent them from imitating other speakers.
*   Regex replacements for div wrapping are now limited to the first match.
*   Gemmi was upgraded to Gemini 2.5 Pro, and model aliases were adjusted.
*   The `regional prompter` was integrated with PAG
*   File formatting was added for HTML, SVG, XML and CSS.
*   The `gent` script for generating tests has been improved with better handling of existing files.
