# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-31 to 2025-04-06

This week was extremely productive, with a strong focus on Ally Chat's user experience, AI capabilities, and under-the-hood improvements. A significant amount of work went into streamlining common Git workflows and introducing an experimental AMPS (actors model programming shell) environment. I was heads down and didn't even see the sun!

## Key Achievements:

*   **Webchat Enhancements:** Improved the webchat UI with scrolling controls, room management menus, simple/advanced mode toggling, and service worker updates.
*   **Ally Chat AI Improvements**: Introduced support for OpenRouter models (Mavi, Skout), refined image generation prompting, and improved markdown handling (include directive, better code blocks).
*   **Developer Tooling: streamlined Git usage with new wrappers and aliases, and began work on AMPS, an embedded DSL for actor-based programming in shell.**

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Webchat Enhancements

The webchat interface received several usability improvements this week.

*   **Scrolling Controls and Room Operations:** Added scrolling controls to make navigating chat history easier, and room operation menus for tasks like copying or moving rooms.
*   **Simple/Advanced Mode:** Introduced a toggle for a simplified interface, hiding advanced features for new users.  File upload was enabled in the simple mode.
*   **Service Worker Improvements:** Reworked the service worker setup for both the chat and rooms subdomains, improving caching and update reliability and added `debug.js` and `resizer.js` to service worker cache.
*   **Font Update:** Updated the main font to "IBM Plex Sans" for better readability, particularly distinguishing between 'I' and 'l'.
*   **Message IDs:** Added the option to display message IDs above chat messages, either always visible or on hover.
*   **Image Viewer Fix:** Resolved an issue where hidden or soft-deleted images were included in the image viewer.

### Ally Chat AI Improvements

The AI-powered features of Ally Chat saw significant improvements:

*   **OpenRouter Support:**  Implemented support for OpenRouter, adding the `Mavi` and `Skout` models.
*   **Image Generation Prompting:**  Refined image generation instructions for the `Illu` and `Pixi` agents, removing NSFW terms, improving quality setting descriptions, adding dimension shortcuts, and improving quoting instructions. Ages were added to all agents.
*   **Markdown `include` directive**: Added support for an `include` directive within Markdown code blocks, allowing for files and URLs to be embedded directly in the chat.  The directive shows the URL and hides the content in an expandable section.

### Developer Tooling Improvements

This week saw work on both existing and brand-new tooling to help speed up development.

*   **Git Workflow Enhancements**: Streamlined common Git operations with new wrapper scripts and aliases.  This included shortcuts for `git add` with directory-aware path handling (aliases `ad` and `ad+`), wrappers for `git diff` and `vimdiff` (aliases `gd`, `gds`, and `gvd`), and improvements to the `git_pull.sh` script (added stash option). A `git status` wrapper with colored pager output was also created and aliased to `st`. A `git clone` command was added to convert https URLs to ssh.
*   **AMPS: Actor Model Programming Shell**:  Implemented an AMPS shell script generator and initializer, including a graphviz `dot` graph generator for visualizing AMPS programs. AMPS is designed to make it easier to manage complex actor-based programs with shell scripts, handling dependency ordering and symlinking arguments.

### Codebase Refactoring and Maintenance

*   **Dependency Management**: Improved dependency management by reorganizing Python dependencies and Debian packages in the install script.
*   **Path Handling**:  Cleaned up path handling in `env.sh` and enabled the `arcs` directory.
*   **Build Script Improvements:** Removed unnecessary Gradio and gTTS dependencies from the install script and improved error handling in `visual/Makefile`.
*   **Function Extraction Order**: improved function extraction order in AST parsing.
*   **split `chat.py` into multiple files.**

This was a busy week, laying the groundwork for future features and significantly improving the development workflow.
