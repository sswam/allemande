# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-07 to 2025-04-13

This week, is focused on expanding Ally Chat's AI model integrations, enhancing markdown support, and addressing a few UI and code-related issues. It was a real sprint, getting back into the flow!

## Key Achievements:

*   **Expanded AI Model Support:** Added support for new models including Alibaba Qwen, Gemma, and updated configurations for existing Gemini and OpenRouter models.
*   **Improved Markdown Handling:** Fixed several issues related to inline math, code blocks, and table conversion, enhancing the chat's rendering capabilities.
*   **Agent Updates and Safety Improvements:** Continued refining agent configurations, including age adjustments, clothing descriptions, and added a few lines of code to ensure image-generating agents tend to make adults.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Minor UI and UX improvements in the webchat interface, including LaTeX rendering, and a new dedent function in the editor.
*	**Added tools for GPU and Firewall Management.**

## Detailed Breakdown:

### AI Model Integrations

Ally Chat's strength lies in its support for a wide range of AI models. This week saw the addition of several new models:

*   **Alibaba Qwen:** Integrated Alibaba's QwQ 32B and EVA Qwen2.5-72B models, adding corresponding agent YAML files (Eva and Qwen).
*   **Gemma:** Added new agent definitions for the Gemma family, including Gemma and Lavi, leveraging the openrouter connection.
*   **Gemini and OpenRouter Updates:** Refined configurations for existing Gemini and OpenRouter models, adding openrouter alternatives for Gemini models and updating model parameters.  This included specifying a `repetition_penalty` for `Mavi`.

These additions expand the platform's AI capabilities and give users more options for interacting with AI agents.

### Markdown Enhancements

Markdown is the foundation of Ally Chat's rich text capabilities. This week's improvements focused on fixing edge cases and improving rendering accuracy:

*   **Inline Math Fixes:** Resolved issues with inline math rendering, ensuring correct handling of delimiters and edge cases.
*   **Code Block Improvements:** Improved handling of code blocks with better whitespace management.
*   **Table Conversion:** Refactored the Markdown table to TSV converter using the `csv` module for increased reliability.

These changes ensure that the chat displays content accurately and consistently, creating a better user experience.

### Agent Updates and Safety Improvements

Ongoing work continues on refining the personalities and capabilities of the AI agents in Ally Chat. This week, a focus was set to ensure safety.

*   **Age Adjustments:** All agents now default to age 23. The ages were standardized, removing descriptors like "skinny", and a few lines of code were introduced to ensure image-generating agents tend to make adults.
*   **Clothing Descriptions:** Updated clothing descriptions for various characters, adding more detail and consistency, especially for Ally, Barbie and Gabby.

### UI/UX Improvements

This week included UI/UX improvements.

*   **LaTeX Rendering:** Integrated client-side KaTeX rendering to support LaTeX formulas directly in the chat interface.
*   **Editor Enhancements:** Added a dedent shortcut and button to the editor, along with renaming the indent button for clarity.

### Tooling

A couple of convenient commandline tools were added this week, too:

*   **GPU Usage Reporting:** Added a tool `nvidia_usage.py` to report GPU memory usage per process.
*   **Remote User Firewall:** Added a new `remote_user_firewall.sh` script.

### Other Updates and Fixes

*   **nginx Configuration:** Disabled `Cache-Control` headers in the nginx configuration to prevent caching issues.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Specified alternative gir dev packages in `debian-allemande-deps.txt` using pipe syntax.
*   **Git Workflow Enhancements:** Added `mdcd` and `i` to canon links in the Makefile.
*   **Perplexity Fix:** Ensured that stop sequences are cleared before engaging with the Perplexity chat model.

## Next Steps:

*   Continue refining AI agent personalities and capabilities.
*   Investigate user suggestions for new features and improvements including math-input TTS.
*   Address any remaining rendering issues in the markdown.
