# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-14 to 2025-04-20

This week was heavily focused on setup and documentation improvements, along with some new agent integrations, and various quality-of-life enhancements to Ally Chat. I spent a significant amount of time addressing installation issues reported by users and cleaning up the codebase.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Major Setup and Install Fixes:** Addressed a wide range of installation issues.
*   **New Agent Integrations:** Added a new agent, Rocki, based on the Grok-3 model, and also Borat with a Llama model.
*   **Refactored and Improved Code Quality:** Cleaned up code, improved testing, and enhanced tooling scripts.
*   **Documentation Updates:** Expanded and refined documentation files and guides, providing clearer instructions and details.
*   **UI/UX improvements:** Added a 3-level compact view mode, added some audio controls, and fixed scrolling.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Setup and Install Improvements

This week's focus included significant work on improving Ally Chat's installation process.  I addressed issues related to nginx configuration, user setup, and dependency management. Changes were made to the `adm/allemande_install.sh`, `adm/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`, `adm/nginx/sites-available/*`, and `adm/web_install.sh` scripts, among others, to ensure a smoother and more reliable installation experience.  Notably, the install process now properly handles domain names, and JWT secrets. There were also several fixes for package management. Some setup and build scripts were improved, like `nginx_build_with_jwt.sh`.

### New Agent Integrations

The diversity of AI agents is a key feature of Ally Chat.  This week I added two new agents with distinct personalities.

*   **Rocki:** A Grok-3-based agent, was added.
*   **Borat:** Created a Borat agent config using a llama model.

Additionally, existing agent definitions were updated to leverage new and improved models.

### Code Quality Improvements

Several changes were made to improve code quality, robustness, and maintainability.

*   **Refactored code** and centralized functions in javascript.
*   **Added robustness** to atail.py, and added comprehensive tests.
*   **The file watching script, `awatch.py`, was improved,** and initial scan was added.
*   **A tool to relocate Python venvs (`venv_move.sh`)** was added.
*   **Various tools were improved** including a shell header tool (`sh_header.sh`) and file sorting utilities.

### Documentation Updates

I updated documentation files and guides with information about Ally Chat's features and usage. This includes:

*   Ally Chat User Interface Guide.
*   Updated setup and install guides.
*   Added details about how to setup secrets and CUDA.

### UI/UX Improvements

Improvements were implemented, including some audio controls (STT, TTS, VAD) to the webchat, as well as privacy indicator, that toggles between user and public rooms. Compact view was extended to a 3-level mode.
