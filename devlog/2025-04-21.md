# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-21 to 2025-04-27

This week was a whirlwind of user experience improvements, agent enhancements, and under-the-hood refinements across Ally Chat. I've been particularly focused on streamlining user interactions and bolstering the platform's AI capabilities.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Improved User Interface and Help System:** Introduced a draggable help widget, enhanced controls layout, and added a table of contents view.
*   **Enhanced Agent Capabilities:** Started on adding a new OpenAI image agent. Added new character agents, and refactored agent handling.
*   **Nginx Configuration Refinements:** Refactored Nginx configurations for improved security, CORS handling, and cache busting.
*   **Codebase Improvements:** Moved user assets, improved code quality, and added scripts for image cleanup and remote user auditing.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### User Interface and Help System Enhancements

This week saw several significant changes to enhance the Ally Chat user experience.

*   **Draggable Help Widget:** A draggable, resizable, and maximizable help widget was introduced. This makes the in-app help system more accessible and user-friendly. The help widget also gained controls (undo, retry, archive, clear).
*   **Table of Contents View:** A table of contents (TOC) view was implemented, providing users with an easy way to navigate long chat histories. This view is mutually exclusive with the canvas view and displayed in a sidebar.
*   **Control Layout and Touch Behavior:** The controls layout was improved, and touch behavior was refined for a smoother experience, especially on iOS devices. Added a pull-to-refresh gesture for iOS, making things feel more native.
*   **View Modes:** The introduction of simple, advanced, and boffin view modes allows users to tailor the interface to their specific needs and comfort levels.
*   **Introduction Text**: Getting started text has been improved, and the help button prioritised in intro documentation.

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities

Several improvements were made to Ally Chat's AI agents.

*   **OpenAI Image Agent:** A new OpenAI image agent Gily was started, a work in progess.
*   **Agent Refactoring:** Agent handling was refactored, with local and remote agent logic extracted into separate modules for better organization and maintainability. The loading of agents has been improved to allow recursive loading, and suffix merging. The system has been updated to prevent accidental self-talk (agents invoking themselves) unless explicitly mentioned with "@".
*   **New Agents:** New character agents Fli, Gemm, and Evan were added.  Eva persona was updated, and Poli and Summi models were updated to `gemini-2.5-flash`.

### Nginx Configuration Refinements

Nginx configurations were refactored to improve security and performance.

*   **Security:** Hidden files (`/.`) are now denied in chat and rooms configurations, improving security.
*   **CORS Handling:** CORS configuration was simplified and improved.
*   **Cache Busting:** A cache-busting rewrite rule was added to the chat configuration (`file.hash.ext` -> `file.ext`), ensuring that users always receive the latest versions of static assets.
*   **Service worker disabled:** service worker has been disabled for the rooms subdomain, avoiding disconnect bugs on Firefox.

### Codebase Improvements

Several changes were made to improve the codebase and infrastructure.

*   **User Asset Relocation:** User-specific assets were moved from `users/` to `static/users/`.
*   **System Password Sync:** The system now synchronizes htpasswd passwords with system passwords using chpasswd, improving security and manageability.
*   **Image Cleanup Script:** A script was added to remove old, untracked images from rooms.
*   **Remote User Auditing:** A new script, `remote_user.sh`, was added for chroot setup and auditing.
*    **Various fixes**: Typos were fixed in documentation and code.
*   **Code Linting:** Add unique flag for linty to de-duplicate output
