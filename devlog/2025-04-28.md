# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-28 to 2025-05-04

This week was focused on improving the Ally Chat platform with new features, bug fixes, and enhancements to existing functionality. A significant focus was on improving the user experience and adding new capabilities to the platform's AI integrations, and some backend improvements.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Enhanced User Interface:** Implemented scrolling buttons in the editor, prevented sending messages to directories, fixed a tab cursor bug, and added a first-visit intro highlighting the help button. The default theme for new users was also changed to `light.css`.
*   **Audio Processing Enhancements:** Added FLAC support to the `see` script and added a `--task` option to the `whisper_cpp.sh` script to select translate.
*   **System Monitoring:** Implemented a standalone system monitoring script for better server oversight.
*   **Remote User Security:** Added scripts and configuration for chrooted remote users, improving security and resource management.
*   **Dependency Management:** Updated the build process to configure CTranslate2 v4.4.0 from source.
*   **Code Refactoring and Documentation:** Refactored the `ffclip` script into a function with parameter validation and reworked the intro documentation for clarity and consistency.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### User Interface Improvements

Several user interface enhancements were implemented this week:

*   **Editor Scrolling:** Scrolling buttons were added to the editor, making navigation within larger files more efficient.
*   **Message Handling:** Implemented a fix to prevent messages from being sent to directories, preventing unintended behavior.
*   **Tab Cursor Bug:** Corrected an issue with the tab key causing incorrect cursor positioning in the input field.
*   **First Visit Intro:** A new feature was added to highlight the help button for first-time users, guiding them towards available assistance. An arrow points to the help button, and other elements are greyed out.
*   **Default Theme:** The default theme for new users was changed to `light.css`, improving the initial aesthetic experience for new users.

### Audio Processing Enhancements

The audio processing capabilities of Ally Chat were expanded with the following improvements:

*   **FLAC Support:** The `see` script now supports FLAC audio files, expanding the range of playable audio formats.
*   **Whisper.cpp Translation Task:** A `--task` option was added to the `whisper_cpp.sh` script, allowing users to select the "translate" task, making it easier to translate audio files using Whisper.

### System Monitoring

*   **Standalone System Monitoring Script:** A standalone system monitoring script, `monitor_standalone.sh`, was added to monitor key system metrics such as disk usage, load average, memory usage, and network connectivity. This script provides command-line options for configuring thresholds and verbosity, improving server oversight.

### Remote User Security

*   **Chrooted Remote User Scripts:** A suite of scripts and configurations were added to support chrooted remote users, enhancing security by isolating remote user environments. These scripts handle user creation, chroot setup, auditing, startup, and systemd integration. Resource limits can be applied via systemd slice configuration.

### Dependency Management

*   **CTranslate2 v4.4.0:** The build process was updated to configure CTranslate2 v4.4.0 from source.

### Code Refactoring and Documentation

*   **ffclip Refactoring:** The `ffclip` script was refactored into a function, and parameter validation was added, improving the script's reliability and usability. Obsolete code was removed.
*   **Intro Documentation Rework:** The intro documentation was reworked for clarity and consistency, providing new users with a better onboarding experience. Formatting was standardized, and the flow was improved for both SFW and NSFW intros.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Record.js Fix:** The `record.js` file was updated to use exported chat functions, addressing issues with recording functionality. Unique IDs were added to message elements. Functions used by record.js are now exported and called via `chat.`
*   **Tab Cursor Bug:** Fixed a bug where the tab key would cause the cursor to jump to the beginning of the input after auto completion.
