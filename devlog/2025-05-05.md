# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-05 to 2025-05-11

This week brought a mix of new features, agent improvements, documentation updates, and some important backend fixes to the Ally Chat platform. We focused on enhancing AI interactions, improving configuration management, and ensuring system stability.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Enhancements:** Several new character configurations were added, existing agent definitions were reorganized and updated, and functionality was added to generate full AI character templates.
*   **Robust Mounting:** Improved the reliability of network mounts.
*   **Configuration Flexibility:** Expanded options for loading configuration files.
*   **Documentation Overhaul:** Improved existing documentation and added a character list.
*   **Improved Stability:** Added retry logic for image generation.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent Enhancements

This week saw significant activity in the agent configuration area:

*   **New Characters:** The following new character configurations were added: Ellie, Mirror, Baymax, Riley, and Yvonne.
*   **Agent Reorganization:** Agent definitions were reorganized into subdirectories (character, art, search, tool, etc.) for better maintainability.
*   **Agent Updates:** Many agent configurations were tweaked with minor fixes and updates, including the age descriptions. Some fictional characters like Borat and Dredd were removed, while the Yvonne character and Chaz specialist were added, The Chaz specialist was updated to use Gemini 2.5 Pro and given expanded instructions for generating full AI character templates.
*   **Grok Model Updates:** xAI models were upgraded to Grok-2/3, with corresponding agent updates and alias additions.
*   **Variable Substitution:** Added the `replace_variables` utility to handle variable substitution in prompts, preserving code blocks, this was needed for new Chaz functionality.

### Robust Mounting

A new, more robust `ally_mount.sh` script was introduced to improve the reliability of network mounts.

*   **Locking:** The script now implements an execution lock to prevent concurrent runs.
*   **Safe Mount/Umount:** The new `safe-mount` function includes connection timeout, keep-alive, and verification mechanisms to ensure successful mounting. A `safe-umount` function was also added for safe unmounting.
*   **Makefile Integration:** The `llm`, `whisper`, and `images` targets in the `Makefile` were updated to run `make mount` first, ensuring that necessary network mounts are established before these processes begin.

### Configuration Flexibility

The system for loading configuration files was enhanced:

*   **Prioritized Loading:** The system now loads `access.yml` before `.access.yml`. If both exist in the same directory, the plain file is used.
*   **Directory Persistence:** After editing `access.yml` or `options.yml`, the view now stays in the current directory.

### Documentation Overhaul

Several documentation updates were made:

*   **Character/Model Guides:** Restructured and updated the character and model guides.
*   **NSFW Guide Simplification:** The NSFW guide was simplified by referencing the main character list. The list of NSFW-capable models was updated.
*   **Character List Generation:** A new `extra.md` file is now generated with a list of all cartoon, celeb, disney, fiction and muppet characters with a makefile target.
*   **Tour Offer:** Added a tour offer to the getting started message for new webchat users.
*   **README Update:** Updated the `README.md` file with the latest guides, models, and tools.

### Improved Stability

*   **Image Generation Retry Logic:** Retry logic with backoff was added to image generation to improve stability.
*   **Webchat help.bb Fix:** Addressed an issue in `webchat_user.sh` where `help.bb` was being overwritten. Now the script copies the `help.bb` file only if it doesn't already exist, preventing accidental overwrites. A delayed background copy was implemented to mitigate file watcher issues.

## Other Changes:

*   **Nginx Configuration:** Redundant set options were removed from `nginx_update.sh`.
*   **Chat Room UI Tweaks:** The room limit, diagram scaling, and light theme colors were updated.
