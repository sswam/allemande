# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-12 to 2025-05-18

This week has been focused on improving AI agent interactions, enhancing mention functionality, refining image generation capabilities, and bolstering privacy measures.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Improvements and Additions:** Several new agents were added, existing agents were refined, and instructions were updated to improve persona consistency and prevent impersonation.
*   **Enhanced Mention System:** The mention system was updated to be case-sensitive for agent names and require an "@" prefix for self and group mentions.
*   **Privacy Enhancements:** Access logging was disabled in Nginx to enhance user privacy.
*   **Image Generation Refinements:** New realism techniques and assets were added for image generation.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent Improvements and Additions

This week saw a flurry of activity related to AI agents:

*   **New Agents:** Cris, Luna, Sal, and Tony were added as new agents. Cris is a constructively critical and skeptical agent, while Luna is a werewolf wilderness guide. Sal is a charismatic pizza shop owner, and Tony is a pizza restaurant phone sales agent.
*   **Agent Refinements:**
    *   System prompts for Eva and Evan were updated to improve persona consistency and prevent them from speaking for other characters, as well as clarifying the intended use of `NAME:` prefixes. A typo fix in slugdorf config was also applied.
    *   The `asian` tag was added to the visual descriptions of several characters, including Eva, Evan, Haka, and Qwen.
    *   The Chaz specialist agent was updated.
    *   Instruction was added to prevent agents impersonating other characters.
    *   The Callam agent's persona instructions were revised.
*   **Agent File Management:** The Chilli agent was renamed to Chillo, and Baymax was moved to a dedicated "disney" directory to keep things organized. The Mirror agent config was deleted.
*   **Ally Configuration Tweaks:** The order of items in Ally's clothes list was adjusted.

### Enhanced Mention System

The mention system received a significant overhaul:

*   **Case-Sensitive Agent Names:** Agent names are now stored and looked up case-sensitively.
*   **"@ Prefix Requirement:**  Self-mentions (e.g., "me," "self") and group mentions ("anyone," "everyone") now require the "@" prefix to trigger.
*   **Refined Plural Keywords:**  Some less common plural keywords (e.g., "y'all," "one of you") were removed, and the list of words for everyone mentions expanded.
*   **Direct Reply Target Validation:**  The system now ensures that the direct reply target is a current participant in the chat.
*   **"Anyone" Mediator Assignment:** The conductor now supports "anyone" for dynamic mediator assignment.

### Privacy Enhancements

User privacy was improved by disabling access logging in Nginx. This change affects the main site as well as the "chat" and "rooms" subdomains.

### Image Generation Refinements

To enhance the realism of generated images, the following changes were made:

*   **Realism Techniques and Assets:** New realism techniques were added to documentation, along with new realism LoRA's and tags.
*   **Illustration Instruction Improvements**: Updated Illu agent instructions for formatting, safety, macros, LoRAs, and multi-char. Instructions on multiple character scenes were updated and clarified. Regional prompting was highly recommended for multi-character scenes.

### Other Changes:

*   **Crowdsec Whitelisting:** A script was added to whitelist the SSH client IP address for 7 days. This script now exits with code 0 if not run via SSH, so it can be safely called as a cron job.
*   **File Modification Time Display:** The `wat` command in the `Makefile` was updated to show file modification times as seconds ago.
*   **Chat Bug Fixes:**
    *   A bug was fixed that prevented the decrement of the send activity counter on message undo.
    *   A bug was fixed that prevented auto-play controls from redrawing when toggled.
*   **Chat Room Improvements:** Intro, guide, and user room links were removed from the base room configurations. Cast members were reordered in the nsfw room configuration.
*   **Room Administration:** Added user dir to rooms/.gitignore, init arcs in user dir. The `remove_old_images_from_rooms.sh` script now operates from the current working directory and properly handles filenames starting with a dash.
*   **Markdown Fix**: Fix markdown parsing for newlines within non-code text.
*   **Agent Response Logic:** The conductor was improved to improve name matching and refine agent response logic.
