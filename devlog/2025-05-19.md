## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Updates and Tweaks:** Several agent configurations were updated, focusing on prompt refinements and visual descriptions.
*   **Image Generation Improvements:** A new 'real' style preset was introduced for image generation, along with updates to LoRA usage and tagging. There was also an attempt to improve hand generation.

*   **Miscellaneous Fixes and Tweaks:** Including disabling mouse drag for image overlay swipe, and a fix for excluding hidden files.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent Updates and Tweaks

This week involved several updates to agent configurations, focusing on improving persona consistency and visual representation. Some key changes include:

*   For image generation agents, the Illu agent had updates to its LoRA documentation and Pony tag usage, as well as refinements to regional prompt examples. The Pixi agent also received updated documentation and instructions, with adjustments to the `system_bottom_pos` parameter.
*   The Jily agent gained an alias, "Illy."
*   The Fli agent got a minor tweak to the `system_top` message.
*   The visual descriptions for Fli, Flashi, Flasho, and Lite were updated, changing the `person` field to '1other' and adjusting gender LoRAs.
*   The Cris agent's prompts were tweaked.

### Image Generation Improvements

Significant effort was put into enhancing the realism of AI-generated images:

*   A new 'real' style preset was introduced, replacing the old 'realism' setting. This involved splitting the old 'realism' setting into `[use real_tags]` and `[use real_loras]`, and creating a new `[use real]` style which incorporates both.
*   The `[use sharp]` style was updated to include `[use real]` to inherit realistic qualities
*   The weights for the realism LoRAs were also reduced.
*   The documentation and examples in Pixi.yml were updated to reflect these changes.
*   PonyXL rating tags in Pixi were standardized.
*   The negative prompts were updated to include "hands" to improve the quality of generated hands, but this was later removed again.

### LLM Updates

The available language models were also updated:

*   Claude 4 Opus was added as a new model (available as the Claudo agent).
*   The internal model key for claude-new was renamed to claude-sonnet, and the Clauden agent was updated to use Claude 4 Sonnet.
*   Gemini model details were also updated.

### Miscellaneous Fixes and Tweaks

Several smaller fixes and tweaks were implemented:

*   Mouse dragging was disabled for the image overlay swipe feature in the room interface. This was causing issues.
*   The `adm/webchat_user.sh` script was fixed to exclude hidden files when creating a new user's help file, and the modification time of the new help file is now explicitly set to the epoch.
*   The `crowdsec_whitelist_ssh_client.sh` script was updated to check for the availability of the `cscli` command before proceeding.
*   Visual parameters were adjusted.
