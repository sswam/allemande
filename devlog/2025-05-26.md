# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-26 to 2025-06-01

This week focused on enhancing the visual generation capabilities of Ally Chat, improving agent personalities and adding new agents, and making some general improvements to the user experience and system administration tools.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Visual Generation Improvements:** Significant enhancements were made to image generation, including race-aware appearance generation, improved emotion expressions, age options and the addition of celebrity LoRAs.
*   **New and Improved AI Agents:** New AI agents, Dax, Eli and Clair were added, and a number of existing agent configurations were updated to better express their intended persona, particularly around image generation.
*   **Browser Extension:** A new browser extension for exporting tabs to a TSV file was developed.
*   **Ally Chat Enhancements:** Several smaller improvements were made to Ally Chat, including improvements to folder views, URL handling, and user theme defaults.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Visual Generation Improvements

A major focus this week was on enhancing the visual quality and realism of generated images, giving the user more control over the appearance of characters.

*   The visual system gained a new emotion system, allowing AI prompts to specify the character's emotional state, and expressive LoRAs were incorporated to visually emphasize emotion.
*   Race-aware human appearance generation was implemented, adding detailed facial features and hairstyles specific to different skin tones. This included creating separate eye and hair color sets for diverse skin tones and race specific prompt options.
*   A weighted age selection system was introduced, and the age/face LoRAs and prompts were refined. The age options were split, with additional options for young adult and middle age, with corresponding LoRA parameters tuned and weighted.
*   A script to create image montages from a set of input images was added.
*   The face generation process now supports the inclusion of female celebrity LoRAs, allowing for images resembling specific actresses. The prompting system for faces was generally refined and reorganized.
*   A weighting system was introduced to control the relative probability of "pretty" and "ugly" faces appearing in generated images.
*   Pony character visuals were implemented, providing for specific facial features, builds, and hair styles to be used in generating Pony-style images. Negative prompts were also updated for Pony and Pony-Anime image generation to improve image quality.
*   Hairstyle generation was centralized in `face.txt`, and "dark-skinned male" descriptors were added to skin descriptions to improve prompt consistency.
*   Finally, some older, less useful options and characters were removed.

### New and Improved AI Agents

The cast of AI agents available in Ally Chat was expanded and existing agents were improved:

*   The Dax AI agent, designed to be quirky and humorous, was added.
*   The Eli agent, designed to explain complex topics in simple terms, was introduced.
*   The Clair agent, designed to use plain language and avoid AI-typical phrasing, was also added.
*   The Cris agent's age was updated to be more specific.
*   The Illu agent was updated to encourage more chatting and to clarify the usage of the `ADDCOL` feature.
*   The Pixi agent was updated to encourage direct replies without image prompts and to omit empty prompt sections when chatting, also updating the agent's identity statement to use `$FULLNAME`.

### Browser Extension

A new browser extension was created to export tabs from the current window to a TSV file, providing a simple way to save and organize browser sessions. A script for categorizing those tabs was also created.

### Ally Chat Enhancements

Several smaller enhancements were made to the Ally Chat platform itself:

*   The default theme for new users was changed to "dark."
*   NGINX site configurations were updated to normalize the character set to lowercase, improving consistency.
*   A fix was implemented to avoid kill attempts on non-existent Automatic1111 processes.
*   The `ally_service` module now includes a `get_user` function to decode the `X-Forwarded-User` header, ensuring proper handling of usernames with special characters.
*   URL handling was improved to preserve forward slashes in URL hash queries, allowing for more complex links within the chat application.
*   Ally room permissions checks were improved to handle non-sanitized pathnames more gracefully, preventing crashes in folder view.
*   A fix was implemented to ensure TSV output from the tab exporter ends with a newline character.
*   The default `top_p` value for the Llama LLM was corrected to 1.0.
*   A feature was added to gate AI-invoked non-tool replies by a new chance configuration, preventing excessive back-and-forth between AI agents.
*   A fix was applied to run the face adetailer last in the adetailer processing chain for art agents.
*   The local agent timeout was increased to 10 minutes to allow for longer-running tasks.
*   Folder view layouts were fixed to avoid clipping in Firefox, and cache busting was implemented to ensure users see the latest folder contents.

### Story Generation Updates

Updates to the story generation scripts:

*   The `illustrate.py` script now supports a `-M/--module` argument for Python-based prompt modification.
*   Image generation will now continue even if an `a1111_client` call fails, preventing the entire story generation process from halting due to a single image generation error.
*   The string `"rating safe"` is now prepended to default non-adult Pony prompts to guide image generation towards safe content.
