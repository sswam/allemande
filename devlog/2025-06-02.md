# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-02 to 2025-06-08

This week's focus was primarily on improving the agent system and the overall chat experience, enhancing image generation capabilities and updating dependencies. We also did some housekeeping, removing some obsolete content and improving documentation.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent System Improvements:** Significant enhancements were made to the agent system, including better local agent loading, the introduction of global agent definitions, and more flexible agent configurations.
*   **Dependency Updates:** PyTorch and related dependencies were updated, along with dependencies for LLM tools, providing access to new AI provider libraries. We now offer CPU, CUDA and ROCm variants of pytorch.
*   **New Agents and Agent Updates:** Several new agents were added, and existing agent configurations were refined, including an image specialist agent named Chas.
*   **Google Gemini update:** Google Gemini integration was updated to use the new `google.genai` SDK.
*   **Web Chat Enhancements:** Boffin mode was restricted to developers and audio button was hidden, alongside other UI tweaks and bug fixes.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent System Improvements

This week brought several enhancements to how agents are defined, loaded, and used within Ally Chat.

*   The local agent loading mechanism was improved to include all ancestor directories up to the `top_dir`, ensuring that agents defined in parent directories are properly loaded.
*   A new `.agents_global.yml` file was introduced for shared agent definitions, providing a central location for defining agents that can be used across multiple rooms.
*   Agent configurations were made more flexible by allowing the `age` field to be a descriptive string (e.g., "25 years old") in addition to a numerical value. This helps with more natural language generation.
*   A bug was fixed to handle file paths correctly when closing the editor.
*   File access permissions were improved, granting read/write access to files within group-writable shared directories.
*   When closing the editor, the file navigation was adjusted to return to the parent directory.
*   More guidance was added on how to create custom characters and agents.

### Dependency Updates

Staying up-to-date with the latest libraries is crucial for performance and access to new features. This week, we focused on updating several key dependencies.

*   PyTorch and its related libraries (torchvision and torchaudio) were updated. The installation process was streamlined by providing separate `requirements-core-cpu.txt`, `requirements-core-cuda.txt`, and `requirements-core-rocm.txt` files for different hardware configurations. The torch version was updated from 2.3.1 to 2.6.0, and the install scripts now uses `index-url`.
*   Dependencies for LLM tools were added, including major AI provider libraries, to a new `requirements-llm.txt` file. This simplifies the setup for users who want to leverage these tools.
*   The `liblist-moreutils-perl`, `argh`, and `equivs` dependencies were added to the Debian setup to support the LLM tools.
*   The `Pillow` dependency was moved from `requirements-1.txt` to `requirements-core.txt`, reflecting its core usage within the application.

### New Agents and Agent Updates

Expanding the roster of AI agents is always exciting, and this week was no exception.

*   A new character design specialist agent, Chas, was added. Chas is designed to help users create original characters by focusing on their key traits, mannerisms, and defining characteristics. Chas can now also use an image as reference for visuals.
*   A new character Cassie was added. Cassie is a tough policewoman.
*   Six new characters were added: Antonio, Cinthia, Freja, Ines, Laura and Valarie.
*   The visual details for Evan and Felix were updated.
*   Gemmy was removed as the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is obsolete.
*   The Illu agent was updated with new poses, views, and macros.
*   The Pixi agent was updated with new instructions and prompt rules, including Draft and Check steps for prompt construction. The instructions on image weight were clarified.
*   The Lavi agent now uses the maverick-free model and some additional parameters were configured.
*   The Nova agent was converted to use the llm_llama type by default.
*   The Ally agent now uses the config section to store detailed parameters.

### Web Chat Enhancements

The user experience is always a top priority, and this week saw several improvements to the web chat interface and functionality.

*   Boffin mode, which grants access to advanced features, was restricted to developers only.
*   The audio button menu was hidden for now.
*   When closing the editor, the file navigation was adjusted to return to the parent directory.
*   Room.undo was made async, and a delay option was added to fix the file processing when restarting from the start.
*   The access check log level was lowered to reduce log clutter.
*   A fix was implemented to ensure that the editor navigates to the parent directory on file close.
*   The `X-Forwarded-User` header is now properly decoded.

### Image Generation Updates

Several updates were made to the image generation process:

*   The Illu agent now supports "pretty" and "ugly" LoRAs, allowing for more control over the appearance of generated images.
*   The Illu agent gained close-up pose/view options.
*   The names of system variables `$NAME` and `$FULLNAME` were documented for the Chaz agent.
*   The documentation clarified that in visual prompts, spaces should be used instead of underscores, and that single adjectives should be used repeatedly (long hair, wavy hair, brown hair) rather than chaining them together (long wavy brown hair).

### Other changes

*   A script was added to display file timestamps.
*   Guidance was added to make simplicity over correctness the primary guidance for AI programming.
