# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-09 to 2025-06-15

This week was all about enhancing the chat experience and expanding our roster of AI agents, refining image generation, and making various quality-of-life improvements. We focused on the user interface, agent personalities, documentation, and fixed a few pesky bugs along the way.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Agent Enhancements:** We added new agents, including the goblin thief Murphy, the narrator Novi, Criss, Kris, and Aethon the orc painter. We also refined existing agent configurations and prompting.
*   **Image Generation Improvements:** The Illu and Pixi agents received significant updates, including LoRA support, enhanced prompting guidelines, and documentation improvements. We also added details for the Poni and Coni image models.
*   **Web Chat UI/UX Updates:** The help system was improved with a new '?' icon, a subtle animation in basic mode, and updated documentation. We also added support for RTL (right-to-left) messages.
*   **Technical Improvements:** Dynamic date/time variables were added to agent prompts, and configurations were tweaked for model temperature and other parameters.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### Agent System Expansion and Refinement

This week we welcomed several new faces (and personalities) to Ally Chat:

*   **Murphy Nightwhisper:** A cunning goblin thief agent, bringing a mischievous flair to the platform.
*   **Novi:** An expert narrator agent designed to create immersive storytelling experiences. We also refactored Nova to use the Novi base, simplifying its configuration.
*   **Aethon Stormbrush:** A formidable orc landscape painter, now available as a character agent.
*   **Criss and Kris:** These new special agents were added.

We also made changes to existing agents:

*   **Hanni's details were updated**, with minor fixes to her description and short agent prompts.
*   **The Illu agent was updated** with OpenAI, LoRA support ("pretty" and "ugly" LoRAs for finer control over appearance), and updated regional prompting documentation.
*   **The Pixi agent's instructions were enhanced**, with better prompting guidelines (including process steps, weighting instructions, negative prompts, and LoRA usage).

### Image Generation Updates

Image generation is a key feature of Ally Chat, and this week saw some important improvements.

*   **LoRA Support:** The Illu agent can now use LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptation) to fine-tune image generation. This includes "pretty" and "ugly" LoRAs, giving users more control over the aesthetic of generated images. The documentation for LoRA usage with Illu and Pixi was improved, including specifics on how to properly use LoRAs in regional prompting.
*   **Pixi Agent Improvements:** The Pixi agent received new instructions and prompt rules, including a "Draft and Check" process for constructing effective prompts. The instructions on image weight were clarified.
*   **Model Documentation:** Details for the Poni and Coni image models were added to the documentation, helping users understand their capabilities.

### Web Chat UI/UX Enhancements

Several changes were made to improve the overall user experience:

*   **Help System:** The help icon was changed to a '?' and animated subtly in basic mode to improve discoverability.
*   **RTL Support:** Added support for right-to-left message display.

### Technical Enhancements

Under the hood, we made several improvements to the platform's technical capabilities:

*   **Dynamic Date/Time Variables:** Agent prompts can now include dynamic date/time variables (e.g., `$DATE`, `$TIME`), allowing agents to be more contextually aware.
*   **Model Temperature Configuration:** We added per-model temperature range configuration, allowing for more granular control over the output of different LLMs. For example, we set a fixed temperature of 1 for o3 and o4-mini models.
*   **Temperature Clamping:** A fix was implemented to ensure that the temperature parameter for LLMs is always clamped within the valid range of \[0, MAX_TEMP].
*   **YouTube Referrer Policy:** Added a `referrerpolicy` attribute to YouTube embeds for improved privacy.

### Other changes

*   We removed the JavaScript lightning bolt animation from the help button, with plans to potentially replace it with a CSS animation later.
*   The default LLama config was symlinked, simplifying configuration management.
*   Removed several age definition files as they are no longer necessary.
*   We added OpenGL demo scripts for quad and spirograph drawing, showcasing the platform's ability to handle graphics programming.
