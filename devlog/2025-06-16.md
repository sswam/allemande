# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-16 to 2025-06-22

This week brought a flurry of activity, focused on agent enhancements, visual upgrades, quality-of-life improvements, and some under-the-hood tweaks. We welcomed new AI personalities, improved image generation, and streamlined various processes.

## Key Achievements:

*   **New AI Agents:** Expanded the agent roster with Azazel, Frank, Klaud, and Veri, each bringing unique personalities to the platform. We also added Logi, a specialist for logical reasoning.
*   **Visual Enhancements:** Refined image generation logic, introduced a "flowers" macro, and improved image text overlay.
*   **Infrastructure Improvements:** Enhanced HAProxy configuration, added a script for Point-Alpaca GGUF conversion, and implemented a utility for buffering stdin.
*   **Flix Browser Extension:** Scaffolding for a new Flix browser extension was implemented.
*   **Vision Updates:** Added Google Gemini vision support and improved context handling for images.
*   **Documentation:** Added a document exploring consciousness and AI ethics.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### New AI Agents and Agent Updates

This week saw significant expansion of our AI agent ecosystem:

*   **Azazel:** A sarcastic and critical minor demon, summoned (against his will) to Ally Chat.
*   **Frank, Klaud, and Veri:** Three new "cautious" special agents designed to be honest, direct, and skeptical, helping to reduce hallucination. Frank is Gemmi-based, Klaud uses Claude, and Veri utilizes Emmy. I even brainstormed some persona-aligned agent names in `name-ideas.txt`.
*   **Logi:** A specialist agent focused on logical reasoning and problem-solving, using a methodical step-by-step approach.
*   **Baymax:** The gentle healthcare companion, updated to clarify when he should ask about user satisfaction after providing care.

Several existing agents received updates:

*   **Chaz:** Now powered by Google Gemini Flash for faster responses.
*   **Illu:** The image generation expert received a new `[use flowers]` macro, and other documentation tweaks.
*   **Jessi:** Prompting instructions were simplified for more creative responses.
*   **Flashi:** The system prompt was refined for better persona adherence.

To keep things organized, I moved personal agents to a new `personal` directory, and also added `/agents/old` to `.gitignore`.

### Visual Updates

Image generation received several updates:

*   **New `[use flowers]` macro:** A macro with a selection of flower types to enhance image prompts.
*   **Photo Prompt Refactoring:** The photo prompt template was split into `cast_photo.txt` to isolate photo-specific elements.
*   **Gender List Logic:** Improved the logic for gender identification in image prompts, using whole-word matching and defining "nonbinary" by excluding "1girl" and "1boy" tags. The script now properly escapes parentheses in the list of flowers.
*   **Image Text Overlay:** Enhanced the image text overlay functionality (details described in the Room Updates section).

### Infrastructure Improvements

This week saw several infrastructure improvements:

*   **Point-Alpaca GGUF Conversion:** Added a script for converting the Point-Alpaca-7B model to GGUF q8_0 format.
*   **HAProxy Configuration:** Enhanced HAProxy configuration with local.ucm.dev SNI support, setting Apache as the default HTTPS backend, increased timeouts, and enforcing HTTPS redirection for most HTTP traffic. All generated HAProxy and Nginx configs now include a "DERIVED FILE" header.
*   **Stdin Buffering Utility:** Introduced a `hold.sh` script to buffer all stdin via a temp file, allowing for delayed execution of commands.
*   **Exit on Error:** Added a `-e` flag to the `wat` script to exit when a command fails.

### Flix Browser Extension

I've begun scaffolding a new browser extension called "Flix," designed to automatically switch streaming subscriptions. The project now has Manifest V3 support with separate `manifest_v2.json` and `manifest_v3.json` files.

### Vision Updates

Ally Chat now supports Google Gemini vision models. The backend can now handle image parts in Google API calls and formats images appropriately. I added an option to send a blank message after an image, and also removed alt text details of generated images from the context markdown before sending to the LLM.

### Documentation

I added a document exploring consciousness, AI, and ethics, including musings on the potential requirements for AI consciousness and ethical implications. I also added a list of unique and unusual features to the docs.
Additionally, the quick intro was updated to clarify the location of the help button.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an access precedence issue in `ally_room.py` by evaluating the deny rule earlier.

### Other additions

*   A simple stdio OpenAI chat client, `minichat.py`
*   A script for sending desktop mail notifications
