# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-23 to 2025-06-29

This week was packed with activity focused on improving agent capabilities, enhancing the user experience, and streamlining administrative tasks. Key areas of focus included introducing new agents, refining existing ones, improving visual generation, and implementing helpful utilities for managing users and agents.

## Key Highlights:

*   **New Agents:**  Added several new agents to the platform, including Lyra (a fitness coach), Aidi (a tech support agent), Misti (furry/pony), and G-Chan and Sixl (AI art). Existing agents like Nicc, Gemini Chan, and Illu received significant updates and refinements. Yenta, a new agent, was added who recommends characters and tools.
*   **Enhanced Visual Generation:** Introduced support for furry and pony-style image generation.
*   **User Experience Improvements:** Added NSFW room access checks and a default "mission" file for new users. Several help texts were also clarified and simplified.
*   **Administrative Tools:** Created scripts for auditing user activity, fixing user directory structures, and comparing user and agent lists.
*   **Performance improvements**: Implemented a priority queue for image generation jobs
*   **GGUF model support**: Added initial support for GGUF models in LLM backend.

## Detailed Breakdown:

### New and Updated Agents

This week brought a wave of new agents and significant updates to existing ones:

*   **Lyra:**  A new energetic fitness coach character was introduced.
*   **Aidi:**  A new SFW tech support agent was added to help users navigate the platform. Aidi's system prompt was refined to provide clearer guidance on using the UI and addressing agents.
*   **Misti:**  A new agent with furry/pony features was introduced, using the OpenRouter and mistral-large models.
*   **G-Chan and Sixl:** Two new AI art agents were added. G-Chan is a concise version of Gemini Chan, while Sixl is an SDXL image generator.
*   **Yenta:** A new agent was introduced who recommends characters and tools. A system was added to generate `summaries.md` and inject it into Yenta's system prompt so she has up-to-date knowledge.
*   **Nicc:** The Tony agent was renamed to Nicc and given a role as a pizza restaurant phone sales agent.
*   **Gemini Chan:** Furry tags were added to Gemini Chan, expanding her visual capabilities.
*   **Illu:**  The Illu agent received several updates, including refinements to pony/furry generation instructions and a switch to using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Instructions were added for generating furry or pony style characters, using `[furry $Name]` and `[pony $Name]` macros.

In other agent related changes: the system prompts of several agents were refactored, often to be more concise.
Additionally the Disney agents were removed from the code repository.
Finally, the Flint welcome message was disabled to prevent the agent from being overly chatty.

### Visual Enhancements

Image generation capabilities were expanded this week:

*   **Furry/Pony Generation:** Support for generating furry and pony-style images was added, including new visual cast templates and the corresponding `furry` and `pony` shortcodes for AI art prompts.
*   **Negative Prompt Improvements:** Standardized negative prompt modifications to use append, ensuring consistency across different generation styles.
*   **Text/Logo/Signature:** Added the ability to include text, logo, and signature in the negative prompt, further refining image generation control.

### User Experience Improvements

Several user experience enhancements were implemented:

*   **NSFW Room Access Check:** Added a NSFW room access check in the authentication process and implemented a navigation link in the UI based on the user's access. This ensures that users only have access to NSFW content if they have the appropriate permissions.
*   **Default Mission File:** Added a default `mission.m` file for new users, providing guidance to AIs on how to assist them.
*   **Help Text Clarification:** Clarified AI addressing syntax in the documentation, emphasizing the use of a capital letter or the `@` symbol when mentioning an agent.
*   **Tool Usage Instructions:** Added usage instructions for tool-based AIs in the documentation, clarifying how to interact with them.
*   **Movable divider improvements:** Added tips for the movable divider to the main guide.

### Administrative Tools

New administrative tools were added to streamline user and agent management:

*   **`webchat_users_audit.sh`:** Audits user activity from room files and updates user records.
*   **`webchat_users_fix.sh`:** Sets up and maintains per-user directory structures and files.
*   **`webchat_users_vs_agents.sh`:** Reports differences between user and agent lists.

### Infrastructure Improvements

*   **Image job priority queue:** Implemented a priority queue for image generation jobs. This improves the fairness by considering job duration and user usage.

### GGUF Model support

This week saw the introduction of initial support for GGUF models. The idle timeout was increased to 120s, and the number of GPU layers was set to 60 in the `Makefile`.

### Other additions
*   A new character Tiga was added.
*   The responsible human user for each conversation is identified and passed to agents.
*   The output line limit parameter was added to Brie.

Overall, this week was highly productive, with a strong focus on improving both the functionality and usability of Ally Chat. The addition of new agents, enhanced visual generation capabilities, and streamlined administrative tools contribute to a richer and more efficient user experience.
