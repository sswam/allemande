# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-30 to 2025-07-06

This week was very productive, with a major focus on enhancing agent capabilities, improving visual generation, and refining the user interface. A significant effort was put into character design, particularly the addition of profile cards and enhancements to image generation prompts. I took about **2 weeks** of vacation since my last coding session!

## Key Highlights

*   **Agent Enhancements:** Dozens of new agent summaries were added and existing agent prompts were refined. Agents now support character card data. A new agent, Lyro, was introduced as an AI prompt optimization specialist.
*   **Visual Generation Improvements:**  Many new image aspect ratios were added, including Tall and Wide formats. A LoRA for plastic clothing was also implemented.
*   **User Interface Enhancements:** Profile cards were redesigned as 3D holographic trading cards. Support for touch events on cards was added. System messages are now hidden from the chat view.
*   **Utility additions**: Added new scripts for relative symlinking, as well as splitting lines into numbered files.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Agent Enhancements

This week brought a large number of updates and improvements to agents, focusing on clarity, specificity, and new capabilities.

*   **New Agent: Lyro:** A new agent called Lyro was introduced. Lyro is an AI prompt optimization specialist, designed to help users craft better prompts for various AI models.
*   **Agent Summaries:** Dozens of new agent summaries were added. The script for generating agent summaries was refactored, and a `--new` option was added to create only new summaries instead of updating existing ones. To keep Yenta up-to-date, a system was added to generate `summaries.md` and inject it into her system prompt. The agent summary script was also improved so that it would only regenerate if it didn't exist, or was older than its source agent's definition.
*   **Agent Refinements:** The system prompts for several agents, including Claude Kun, were refined for clarity and specificity. The prompts for male visual agents were refactored to ensure masculine appearances. The agent aliases for Jily and Sixl were corrected. Brie's skin description was tweaked. Furthermore, a lot of agent's system prompts were reformatted so that there are blank lines to improve readability.
*   **Character Cards:** Character card data was added to the agents. This data includes fields like bio, interests, match, motto, chat, likes, dislikes, and fun facts.
*   **Agent Correctness:** Several issues that could cause the app to crash if agent settings are missing were fixed.

### Visual Generation Improvements

The visual generation capabilities of the platform were significantly enhanced this week:

*   **New Aspect Ratios:** A wide array of new aspect ratios and shortcuts were added for image generation, including tall ("T") and wide ("W") formats. This provides greater flexibility in creating images with different dimensions.
*   **Plastic Clothes LoRA:** A LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for generating plastic clothing was added. Plastic clothes LoRA was added to Illu and a config guide was added so that it can be reused on other agents. A plastic clothes visual data file was also added.
*   **WaterColor generation**: Added watercolor portrait generation.
*   **Prompt Refinements:** Many prompts were refined, typically by adding an additional negative prompt.

### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Profile Card Redesign:** The profile cards were redesigned as 3D holographic trading cards. The new design includes a 3D tilt effect, a holographic shine, glow and texture overlays. Additionally, an algorithm to extract dominant colors from the profile pictures was added, to generate a background gradient on the cards.
*   **Touch Support for Cards:** Touch event handlers were added to enable the shine effect on profile cards on mobile devices.
*   **System Message Hiding:** System messages are now hidden from the chat view, reducing visual clutter.

### Utility additions

*   **Relative Symlinking Scripts:** New scripts (`lnrel` and `lnspwd`) were added to create relative symbolic links. Also added a utility script `find_in_path.sh` which can canonicalize paths
*   **Line Splitting Script:** A script was added to split lines into numbered files.

### Other changes

*   Screen logs are now sent to `stderr` instead of `stdout`.
