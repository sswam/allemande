# Devlog: Week of 2025-07-07 to 2025-07-13

This week's focus was on improving Ally Chat's performance, security, and functionality. Significant effort was put into refining existing tools, adding new features, and fixing bugs to enhance the user experience. A special emphasis was placed on AI agent enhancements, visual generation capabilities, and security measures. I've also started to get a bit more organized by creating a script that generates these devlogs automatically.

## Key Highlights

*   **Agent Enhancements:** Several new AI agents were added (Allie, Ellen, Lori, Lila, Iggy, Jax, Vectr, Aegis Protocol, and Chara), along with many updates and refactorings to existing configurations. These include support for character cards.
*   **Visual Generation Improvements:** Several updates were made to the visual generation process, including the addition of a plastic clothes LoRA and various watercolor styles.
*   **User Experience Improvements:** The new user onboarding experience was refined, user account security was improved, and the Ally Chat UI received a number of enhancements.
*   **Backend Improvements:**  Many new scripts and utilities were added, and improvements were made to logging, security and error handling.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Agent Enhancements

This week brought a significant number of updates and additions to the agent system:

*   **New Agents:** The platform welcomed a wave of new AI agents, such as Allie, Ellen, Lori, Lila, Iggy, Jax, Vectr, Aegis Protocol, and Chara. Each agent brings unique personalities and specialized capabilities to the platform.
*   **Model Updates:** The agents also got updated to use models such as Llama 3.3 70B and EVA Qwen2.5.
*   **System Prompt Refinements:** The system prompts for several agents were refined, clarifying their roles and behavior. The instructions for Aidi were also refined, and new instructions for Fermi were added.
*   **Character Card Support:** Agents now support character card data, which is used to provide detailed information about their personalities, interests, and preferences.
*   **Model Directory Renaming:** The directory for agent model definitions was renamed from `agents/models` to `agents/model`.
*   **WIP Directory:** An `agents/wip` directory was added to store unfinished agents, which are now excluded from build scripts and documentation.

### Visual Generation Improvements

The visual generation capabilities of the platform were significantly enhanced this week:

*   **Art Styles**: New art style LoRAs, such as watercolor, Monet, and Van Gogh, were added.
*   **Plastic Clothes LoRA:** A LoRA for plastic clothes was added, enabling the generation of images with realistic plastic clothing.
*   **Prompt Refinements:** Visual prompts were updated and improved with new appearance tags, including those for Pony models. There were also refinements to make the prompts for male visual agents ensure masculine appearances.

### User Experience Improvements

This week brought a range of improvements to the user experience, focusing on onboarding, authentication, and overall usability:

*   **Onboarding Refinements:** The new user welcome message was rewritten for clarity and brevity. Instructions for NSFW features were also revised.
*   **Authentication Improvements:** Usernames are now handled in a case-insensitive manner, and whitespace is stripped. The maximum age for user sessions was reduced to 7 days to improve security.
*   **Rooms**: Removed whitespace between character cards in Ally Chat.
*   **Profile Cards and Text**: Profile cards and text were updated in Ally Chat.
*   **Focus Management and Theme Switching**: Focus management was improved and theme switching was simplified.

### Backend Improvements

This week included significant enhancements to the backend infrastructure and tooling.

*   **Git History:** A new script was added to generate weekly devlogs from git history.
*   **File Utility Scripts:** A collection of new utility scripts were added, including tools for relative symlinking (`lsrel` and `lnspwd`), line splitting, and more.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling was improved by ensuring the program exits with a non-zero status code on error.
*   **Screen Logs:** Screen logs are now sent to `stderr` instead of `stdout`.
*   **Timed Out Jobs:** Logging was added for skipping jobs that have timed out in the queue.
*   **`ally_commit` Script:** Users are now included in the `ally_commit` script.
