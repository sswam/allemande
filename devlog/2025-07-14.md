*   **Backend & Infrastructure**: Automated safetensors transfer, routed DeepSeek models through OpenRouter, improved error handling, and added a devlog sharing target.

## Detailed Breakdown

### AI Agent Improvements

This week saw a significant overhaul of the agent system:

*   **New Agent: Bish:** Bish, a real-time translation agent utilizing Gemini 2.5 Flash, was introduced. Bish helps facilitate multilingual conversations by translating messages between users speaking different languages.
*   **Meta-Agent Updates:** Loni (formerly Lori) was renamed and her model was upgraded to Gemini 2.5 Flash. Her prompt was also refined for better triage. Frank, a new agent for safety and critical feedback, was introduced.
*   **Specialized Agent Enhancement**: Implemented identity-forwarding for specialist agents, allowing them to adopt the identity of the original agent for seamless role-playing or narration. Aidi's guidance for new users was refined, clarifying the private nature of help rooms and suggesting a beginner flow.
*   **Agent Prompt Updates:** System prompts for various agents were updated to include safety rules and generation advice. Nalani's prompt was updated to enable her to request images of herself via @mention to Xilu.
*   **Welcome Message Control:** Added configuration options for welcome messages, allowing specific agents to restore welcome behavior for advanced users. Welcome messages for Ally, Barbie, and Callam were re-enabled. Welcome messages were disabled for several other agents, including Slugdorf, Clauden, Claude, Claudo, Dese, Emmy, Flashi, Flasho, Grok, Rocki, Clu, Emm, Fli, Gemm, Aegis, Chaz, Clair, Criss, Cris, Frank, Gema, Klaud, Kris, Vega, and Veri.
*   **Code Refactoring:** The characters Lyra and Luna were renamed Aira and Loona respectively.
*   **Category Addition**: Added a new "comedy" category for AI agents.
*   **Forwarding Rules**: Added advanced forwarding capabilities with allow/deny lists, a fallback agent, and content-based triggers for code or images.

### Visual Generation Enhancements

The platform's visual generation capabilities saw several improvements:

*   **Multiple Image Prompts**: Added support for multiple image prompts within a single message, enabling concurrent image generation actions.
*   **LoRA File Uploads:** Implemented support for uploading `.safetensors` files, with automatic transfer to a shared contrib folder. Added logic to reject image jobs if the queue wait time exceeds a predefined limit.
*   **LoRA Mixins:** Introduced a "boring LoRA," a "strong face mixin," and an age rule for more diverse image generation.
*   **Prompt Refinements**: Modified visual prompts with new appearance tags, with improvements made to male agent prompts to ensure masculine appearances. Added new art style LoRAs.
*   **Negative Prompt Handling**: Ensured negative prompts are prepended correctly for better image generation results.
*   **LoRA tag handling**: Prevented `<lora>` tags from being treated as HTML.

### Security Enhancements

Several security measures were implemented this week:

*   **Username Handling**: Hardened username validation by disallowing usernames that start with a dash and consolidating user validation logic.
*   **Session Management**: Reduced the maximum age for user sessions to 7 days.
*   **File Deletion Confirmation:** Added a confirmation prompt to the image deletion script, requiring users to confirm the hostname, working directory, and age threshold before proceeding.

### User Experience Improvements

User experience enhancements were a major focus this week:

*   **New User Onboarding**: Tailored the onboarding experience for new users, providing custom welcome messages and mission files for both SFW and NSFW users. The welcome message was rewritten for clarity.
*   **Image Display Options:** Added a three-state image view with blur mode, allowing users to choose between off, on, and blurred image display. Blurred images un-blur on hover.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Disabled annoying keyboard shortcuts for chat to improve usability.
*   **Directory Navigation**: Implemented truncation of long directory names in the directory listing, with the full name revealed on hover.

### Backend and Infrastructure

Underlying infrastructure and backend processes were improved:

*   **Safetensors Automation**: Automated the transfer of `.safetensors` files from the contrib directory to the LORA path.
*   **DeepSeek Routing:** Configured deepseek models to be routed through OpenRouter.
*   **Devlog Automation**: Added a 'share' target to export devlogs to ALLEMANDE\_ROOMS, and finished the AI-generated retrospective devlog script from git history.
*    **File Management**: Added scripts to organize .safetensors files.
*   **Job Management**: Increased job and queue delay limits for image generation.

This week saw a great deal of progress across many areas of the Ally Chat project. The new features, optimizations, and fixes have significantly improved both the user experience and the underlying platform. It's great to see the project evolving so quickly.
