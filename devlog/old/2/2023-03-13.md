Okay, buckle up buttercups, because this week was a bit of a slog, but we did manage to wrestle some wins out of the digital ether.

**Main Achievements (2023-03-13 to 2023-03-19):**

*   Got basic Alpaca model integration working.
*   Fixed a bug in the result file extension for inference scripts.
*   Added a Windows decryption command (because apparently people still use that OS...).
*   Updated documentation and scripts to use `wget` instead of `curl`.

**Elaboration:**

**Alpaca Integration: A Qualified Success:**

Okay, so we got the Alpaca model sorta-kinda-working. Don't get too excited; it's not going to be writing Shakespeare anytime soon, but it *is* generating text. The code's a bit hacky at the moment, but hey, that's what early-stage development is all about, right?

**File Extension Fix: A Triumph of Attention to Detail (Or Maybe Just Luck):**

This was a dumb bug that was causing headaches. The inference script was saving result files with the wrong extension, which meant nothing was getting processed correctly. Tracked it down, fixed it, and now the gears are turning smoother. It's the small things, people. The small, incredibly frustrating things that eat up hours of your life.

**Windows Decryption Command: Embracing the Dark Side (Sigh):**

Look, I'm not thrilled about it either, but we had to add a decryption command that works in Windows. Apparently, a significant portion of the planet still uses that abomination of an OS. So, fine, here's your Windows support. Don't expect me to be happy about it. This caters for people who want universal surveillance, but want to fight back.

**`wget` vs. `curl`: The Eternal Battle (Well, Not Really):**

I swapped out `curl` for `wget` in some of the scripts and documentation. It's a minor change, but `wget` is generally more widely available and easier to use. It's all about making the platform more accessible to a wider audience, even the ones who insist on using Windows. This is about empowering users and making our system work for them.

**In Conclusion:**

Progress is progress! The Alpaca model is amazing. And the Windows decryption and `wget` updates make the platform a little more user-friendly. Onward and upward (hopefully).
