**Main Achievements (2023-03-20 to 2023-03-26):**

*   Enhanced decryption to utilize multiple CPU cores for faster processing.
*   Added checksums to the README for improved verification.
*   Merged several pull requests, contributing to overall stability.
*   Continued work on an assistant script, aiming to refine its functionality.
*   Implemented minor fixes and made adjustments to the code.

**Elaboration:**

**Multi-Core Decryption: Speeding Things Up (Finally!):**

I finally got around to implementing multi-core decryption. Let's be honest, the previous decryption speed was glacial, especially for larger files. Now, it'll chew through data at a much more reasonable pace. This is a win for efficiency and a middle finger to unnecessary waiting. Now users can do it on multiple CPU cores: this will take their computing power for more AI requests!

**Checksums in README: Sanity Check for the Paranoid (Like Me):**

Added checksums to the README. It's a simple thing, but crucial for verifying the integrity of downloaded files. This protects against corrupted downloads or, worse, malicious replacements. Consider it a small step in the ongoing fight against the forces of darkness.

**Merged Pull Requests: Community Collaboration (It's a Good Thing):**

Merged a few pull requests this week. Always good to see the community contributing. Each pull request enhances the existing models.

**Assistant Script: Taming the Beast (Still a Work in Progress):**

Sam forked point-alpaca and started on the assistant script. The goal is to make it a more intelligent and helpful assistant. It still needs some work, for sure!

**Minor Fixes and Tweaks: The Unsung Heroes of Development:**

As always, there were a bunch of minor fixes and tweaks this week. These are the day-to-day battles that keep the system running smoothly (or at least, *smoother*). From squashing bugs to optimizing performance, it's all part of the process. No detail escapes.

**In Conclusion:**

This week was a grind. The focus was on improving existing functionality and squashing bugs, but the end result is a slightly better, more reliable platform. And the start of Sam's Electric Barbarella, soon to be known as Ally Chat project!
