**`video-to-flashcards`: Turning YouTube Doomscrolling into (Maybe) Learning:**

I decided that passively watching videos online is a giant waste of time, so I started working on a script to turn video content into flashcards. The idea is to use AI to extract key information from videos and format it into flashcards for later review. Maybe this will help people retain something after they watch 10 hours of YouTube lectures. I'm hoping to reduce the amount of useless information intake into the brain.

**Whisper Large Integration: No More Guessing What They're Saying:**

Upgraded the whisper model from small to large! The existing scripts used whisper models for transcription, and now they are using whisper large. This helps for greater accuracy of videos.

**GPT-4 Integration: Unleashing the Beast (at a Higher Cost):**

Enabled GPT-4 in the web search, video processing, and flashcard creation scripts. GPT-4 ain't cheap, but if you want intelligence then you must pay a bit more!

**OCR Script: Reading Images Like a Robot:**

Developed an OCR script that extracts text from images. It's simple, but functional, and could be useful for all sorts of things, from recognizing text in screenshots to processing scanned documents.

**Voice Adjustments: Fine-Tuning the AI's Vocal Chords:**

I made some adjustments to the voice tone in the scripts that uses voice, because it needed tweaking. I added a male voice option. Because reasons.

**Minor Fixes and Tweaks: The Invisible Work That Keeps Things Running:**

A whole bunch of minor fixes and tweaks were done this week. These are the unsung heroes of development, the tiny adjustments that prevent catastrophic failures and keep the project moving forward.

**In Conclusion:**

Another week, another round of incremental improvements. The focus was on automation, video processing, transcription, and integration of GPT-4.
