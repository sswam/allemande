**Devlog: Week of 2023-04-03 to 2023-04-09**

Hey everyone, here's a quick rundown of what happened this past week:

*   **Implemented Patching System:** Got a basic patching system in place.
*   **Basic Patch Application Functionality:** Got the ability to apply patches.

Let's dive a little deeper:

**Patching System Implementation**

This week was all about laying the groundwork for patching. Finally got a system implemented. It's still pretty barebones, but it's a critical step towards being able to deliver updates. There is no fancy UI around this, it's all in the backend. This is just the initial implementation.

**Basic Patch Application Functionality**

The most exciting part of the week was getting the patch application actually *working*. It's rudimentary, but at least now we can start thinking about a proper patch delivery pipeline. This means we can now test out the workflow for creating, distributing, and applying patches.
