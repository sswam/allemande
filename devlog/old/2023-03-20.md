### Devlog: Week of March 20-26, 2023 - The Alpaca Aftermath

After last week's mad scramble to wrangle the Alpaca model, this week was all about cleaning up the mess. The initial integration was powerful and exciting, but the result was a chaotic hole in the wall. This week, we brought in the engineers to frame it, run the electrical, and put up some drywall. It's the unglamorous but necessary work that turns a chaotic breakthrough into a stable, usable feature.

Here’s the rundown of the main achievements:

*   **A massive push on documentation and usability.** Focused on clarifying the real-world hardware requirements, quantization details, and setup process so people with a clue can actually run this thing.
*   **Performance tuning and refactoring.** The initial scripts were brute-force. We made them smarter, including a multi-core decryption process to speed up setup.
*   **Handled the first community pull requests for the Alpaca integration.** It seems we're not the only ones excited about this.
*   **Sam forked `point-alpaca` to start work on Ally Chat.

#### You WILL Read The F*cking Manual

A tool is only as good as its instructions, especially when that tool can melt your GPU if you look at it wrong. The bulk of this week was spent on the least glorious but most important task: documentation.

We added explicit hardware requirements, including VRAM notes for common cards like the 3060. We clarified the trade-offs of quantization—the voodoo that shrinks models down to a manageable size at the cost of some precision. We also added checksums to the `README`. If you're going to download gigabytes of model weights, you should be able to verify you got the right, untampered files. It’s basic digital hygiene.

#### A Little Help From Our Friends

In a welcome turn of events, we didn't have to do all the cleanup ourselves. We got a couple of pull requests from the community (`jasonborn0` and `Neon4o4`), helping to polish the new functionality. This is precisely the point of building in the open. You attract people who are smart enough to see the potential and willing to contribute. It validates the entire approach: build powerful, open tools, and the community will help you make them better.

We also took another pass at the setup scripts. The original decryption process was single-threaded and slow. The new version (`Update: decrypt with multiple CPU cores`) now spins up multiple cores to get the job done faster. Less time waiting on setup means more time actually using the damn thing.

This week wasn't about a new, shiny feature. It was about paying the tech debt from the last one. Now that the Alpaca integration is stable, documented, and performing better, we can get back to building the next crazy thing. Onward.

#### Stealing the Beast

I forked the point-alpaca repo and started work on Electric Barbarella, soon also to be known as Ally Chat, on the 22nd. Started working on "an assistant script", little did I know where it would end up!
