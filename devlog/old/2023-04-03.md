# Devlog: April 3-9, 2023

Key developments this week:
- Added CLIP interrogator functionality
- Implemented ChatGPT model switching improvements
- Created new voice interaction features
- General code cleanup and organization

## CLIP Interrogator Integration

Pulled in the CLIP interrogator from upstream and made some improvements. This gives us better image analysis capabilities - useful for generating more accurate image descriptions and prompts. The integration required some license handling and minor tweaks to make it play nice with our existing setup.

## ChatGPT Model Switching Enhancement

Made significant updates to our ChatGPT model switcher. The script now properly updates from the main selector, making model switching more reliable. Had to do some ESLint cleanup here - the code was getting a bit messy.

## Voice Interaction Features

Added a toggle-mic script and made several improvements to voice chat functionality. Fixed some bugs in the watching system and voice chat implementation. This makes the voice interaction more stable and usable.

## Code Organization and Cleanup

Did a fair bit of housekeeping this week:
- Moved search.py to root directory
- Reorganized various scripts and tools
- Ran ESLint and fixed code style issues (this took three commits - always more cleanup than you expect)
- Updated various README files for better documentation

It was mostly a week of refinement and stabilization rather than major new features. The focus was on making existing functionality more robust and easier to maintain.
