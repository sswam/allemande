## Devlog: Week of 2023-03-20 to 2023-03-26

**Summary:**

*   Refactored the decryption script to use multiple CPU cores for faster decryption.
*   Sam forked the point-alpaca repo, and started building an assistant.py script for interacting with language models.
*   Added example scripts (`eg/watch`, `eg/free-form`) to run the assistant in "watch mode".
*   Added a `chat.vim` for auto-reloading the chat file during `watch` mode.
*   Tweaked model generation parameters.
*   Added checksums to the README for verification.

**Details:**

This week was pretty busy! A big win was getting the decryption process sped up.  Previously, decrypting the model weights was a bit of a pain.  The updates to `decrypt.py` use multiprocessing to leverage multiple CPU cores.  This should significantly reduce the time it takes to decrypt the model files, which is great for anyone wanting to get up and running quickly.

To help users verify the integrity of the downloaded files, we added MD5 checksums to the `README.md` for the encrypted files, the original weights, and the decrypted model files. This should prevent headaches caused by corrupted downloads.

The week, I forked the point-alpaca repo and started work on his deranged Electric Barbarella project! The main focus this week has been starting on an assistant script which I'm calling `assistant.py` (formerly just `assistant` without the `.py`).  The goal is to create a command-line tool for interacting with large language models, specifically the Alpaca model for now. This involved:

*   **Initial Script Creation:** The `assistant.py` script handles loading the model (using the Transformers library and `accelerate` for GPU usage, with some configuration for device mapping and memory management, including use of `torch.float16` for faster and less memory intensive inference). It also includes functions for generating text from a prompt (`gen`), managing conversation history, and trimming the responses. It uses `readline` for a nicer interactive experience, including pre-filling the input field.

*   **Model Loading and Caching:** The script uses a `model_cache` dictionary to store loaded models, so it doesn't have to reload the same model every time you run it.

*   **Configuration:** The assistant uses YAML configuration files (like `config/default.yaml` and `config/experiment.yaml`) to manage generation parameters like `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, `repetition_penalty`, etc. This makes it easier to experiment with different settings.

*   **Watch Mode:** To facilitate quick experimentation, I added a "watch mode" where the assistant monitors a file for changes and automatically uses the content of that file as input to the model. This is enabled with the `-w` option. This works with `chat.vim` to make a simple chat interface in vim.

*   **Example Scripts:**  I created example scripts in the `eg/` directory:
    *   `eg/watch` is a simple script that runs the assistant in watch mode, using the default configuration.
    *   `eg/free-form` is a similar script, but it's configured for "raw" or "free-form" input (with `--no-trim` to disable response trimming, and `--delim $'\n'` to avoid extra delimiters). This is useful when you want the model to potentially predict the user's turn too.

*   **Path Issues:** There was a minor bug related to paths when using watch mode. The current working directory was not being passed to the assistant properly when launched from the `eg/*` scripts, so I added `dir="$PWD"` to those scripts to pass the current directory correctly using `-w "$dir"`.

*   **Tweaks**: Tweaks were made to the model generation parameters in `config/experiment.yaml` to improve performance.

*   **Rename:** The assistant script was renamed from `assistant` to `assistant.py` to make it more suitable for use as a module and with testing frameworks like `pytest`.
