## Devlog: 2023-03-27 to 2023-04-02

**Summary:**

*   Significant progress on the Barbarella project, focusing on voice chat functionality and integrating with GPT models.
*   Implemented a new voice chat script (`bb-voice-2.sh`) and refined the audio processing pipeline.
*   Enhanced the `gpt` tool with new scripts for various text processing tasks (summarization, flashcard generation, code improvement, etc.).
*   Added OCR functionality to extract text from images using Tesseract and GPT for error correction.
*   Improved the setup and usage of LLMs and TTS engines in scripts, and also addressed a couple of user-interface issues.

**Details:**

This week was a busy one, with a lot of activity centered around making Barbarella more interactive and integrating it with the power of large language models. The main focus was on enabling voice chat and building tools around that.

*   **Voice Chat Implementation:** A major effort this week was the creation of a new voice chat script, `bb-voice-2.sh`.  This script is designed to work with `mike.py` (a speech-to-text tool) and a text-to-speech system.  It manages the flow of conversation between a user and a bot, using the chat history file as the communication channel. The script also includes logic to adjust audio capture levels during speech synthesis, and has been adapted to pick up on existing files, rather than creating them over from scratch. I also renamed old `speak` to `speak.sh` to prevent masking.
*   **Audio Processing Refinement:** The `bb-voice-2.sh` script saw several refinements, including adjustments to voice tone using the `speak.sh` script with `soundstretch`, and modifications to how the script handles existing files.
*   **GPT Integration and Tooling:** A suite of new scripts were added under the `gpt/` directory.  These scripts act as specialized interfaces to the OpenAI GPT API, providing convenient ways to perform tasks like summarizing text (`gpt-summary`), generating flashcards (`gpt-flashcards`), improving code (`gpt-code`, `gpt-debug`, `gpt-todo`), splitting text into paragraphs (`gpt-split`), "insanifying" text (`gpt-insanify`), creating tutorials (`gpt-tutorial`), and extracting the topic of some text (`gpt-topic`). There's also `gpt-loop`, which automatically applies GPT to newly modified chat files, and `gpt-pp`, which formats chat.
*   **OCR Functionality:** A significant addition was the `gpt/ocr` script. This script combines Tesseract OCR with GPT to extract text from images and correct OCR errors. The script includes prompts designed to guide GPT in cleaning up the extracted text.
*   **File Management and Utilities:**
    *   Several new helper scripts were created or tweaked, such as `speak.py`, `mike.py` and `search.py`.
    *   Added `.gitignore` entry to ignore the `video/` directory, to prevent generated files from being committed.
*   **Editor UI**: A file at `chat.vim` indicates some work on improving the editor user interface in `vim`.

In summary, this week's work demonstrates a clear push towards building a more complete and interactive AI chat experience, with a strong emphasis on voice interaction, text manipulation using GPT, and the ability to extract information from various sources.
