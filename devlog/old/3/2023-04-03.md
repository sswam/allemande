## Devlog: Week of 2023-04-03 to 2023-04-09

**Summary:** This week focused on enhancing Electric Barbarella with text processing tools, improving the voice chat functionality, and adding a ChatGPT model switcher. Work was also done on automating flashcard creation from videos and setting up an AI model server.

**Elaboration:**

*   **ChatGPT Model Switcher**:  A new ChatGPT Model Switcher userscript was developed. It allows users to switch between different ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5, Legacy ChatGPT, and GPT-4) mid-conversation, in the official app. This involved creating a UI element (a `select` dropdown) injected into the ChatGPT interface using JavaScript. The script also overrides the `window.fetch` function to modify the API requests, ensuring the selected model is used for each request. A MutationObserver was added to update the message displayed when the model is switched.

*   **Text Processing Tools**: A suite of command-line text processing tools were imported or written (who remembers?!), many of them implemented in Python or Perl. These include utilities for:
    *   Adjusting blank lines (`adjust-blank-lines`)
    *   Converting Python-style indentation to C-style braces (`brace.py`)
    *   Concatenating files with paragraph breaks and optional headers (`catpg.sh`, `cat-sections.py`)
    *   Converting HTML to CSS selectors (`html2selectors.py`)
    *   Reversing paragraphs in a text file (`pgtac.py`)
    *   Converting record-oriented data to TSV format (`recs2tsv.pl`)
    *   Generating shell scripts from templates (`shell-template.sh`)
    *   Removing multiple blank lines (`single-blank-lines.pl`, `squeeze-blank-lines.pl`)
    *   Splitting files based on a delimiter (`split-file.py`)
    *   Splitting long sentences, leveraging AI to do so (`split-long-sentences-ai.py`)
    *   Splitting text into sentences (`split-sentences.py`)
    *   Stripping whitespace from lines (`strip-lines.py`)
    *   Converting tabs to spaces, and normalizing indentation (`tab.py`)
    *   Mimicking `tail -f` without rewinding on file size decrease (`tail-f.py`)
    *   Converting TSV files to Markdown tables (`tsv2markdown.py`)
    *   Splitting text into words (`words-split.py`) and joining them back together again (`words-join.py`).

*   **Improved Voice Chat**:  Several changes were made to improve the voice chat functionality, especially the `bbv` script:
    * The `bbv` script was refactored and moved to the `voice` directory. It's now structured with separate scripts for brain (Barbarella AI), microphone input, and text-to-speech, each running in its own `xterm` window.
    * A new `env.sh` script was introduced to manage environment variables related to the voice chat setup (user, bot, paths, default speaking models, etc).
    * A `toggle-mic.sh` script was added for toggling the microphone state using `amixer`.
    * A `tail-f.py` script was created to mimic `tail -f`'s functionality without rewinding on file size decrease, which is important for the live chat stream.
    * A bug with emojis was fixed in one of the voice chat scripts.
    * The microphone input process (mike.py) now has an option to disable automatic adjustment for ambient noise.

*   **Automated Flashcard Generation**: Continued progress was made on the automated flashcard generation pipeline from YouTube videos, controlled by the `video-to-flashcards.make` Makefile.  The recipe now extracts the title of the video, and attempts to search for lyrics or transcripts from external websites using `search.py`.

*   **AI Model Server**: Initial steps were taken to create an AI model server using `future/core.py`. This will likely be the basis for hosting and managing the AI models used by Electric Barbarella!

*   **Search Utility:** The `search.py` utility was moved to the root directory, making it more accessible. It now uses BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing to perform web searches using Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and YouTube.

*   **OCR and Image Handling**:  An OCR workflow was added using Tesseract to extract text from images and then leveraging GPT to correct any OCR errors. A script for generating masks was also added.

*   **Licensing and Structure:** Licenses for `clip-interrogator` were added.
