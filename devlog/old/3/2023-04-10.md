**Devlog: 2023-04-10 to 2023-04-16**

**Summary of Achievements:**

*   **Created new `adm` module and `sync-project` script:** This script automates the process of syncing the main branch with other branches in the repository.
*   **Implemented Anthropic Claude API integration:** Added a new library/tool (`anthropic/claude.py`) to interact with the Anthropic Claude API, allowing for text completion and streaming responses.
*   **Refactored audio processing scripts:** Reorganized the audio processing scripts, including `mike.py` (speech-to-text via microphone) and `speak.py` (text-to-speech), into the `audio` directory. Also created `audio/toggle-mic.sh` to toggle the microphone.
*   **Implemented Chat API Client and Server (Chat v2):** Added chat API client `chat/chat-2.py` and a basic chat API server `chat/chat-3.py` to the project.
*   **Developed code summary tools:** Focused on creating tools that help summarize code, particularly for NetLogo projects.  These tools include scripts for splitting NetLogo files, topological sorting, and generating documentation.
*   **Created embedded interpreters in C:** Working in the `c` folder to implement embedded language interpreters for Lua, MozJS, Perl, Python, QuickJS, Ruby, and V8.
*   **Improved command-line usability** Many file locations now use the `$ALLEMANDE` environment variable to find files and libraries.
*   **Minor fixes and improvements:** Various bug fixes, indentation fixes, and improvements to existing scripts.
*   **Added documentation:** Created new README files for `allemande` and `barbarella`.
*   **Integrated chat API with voice chat:** Voice chat is now using the core chat API server.

**Elaboration:**

*   **`adm/sync-project` script:** This script streamlines the development process by automating the synchronization of branches. It checks out the `main` branch, adds and commits any changes (using `git-add-commit`), runs `arcs` for backing up the repository, pushes to the remote, and then pulls any remote changes.  Finally, it merges `main` into `allemande` and `barbarella` branches, pushes/pulls those branches, and returns to the `main` branch. It prevents edit messages during the merge with the `--no-edit` flag, and switched from `git-confirm-add-commit` to `git-add-commit`.
*   **Anthropic Claude API integration (`anthropic/claude.py`):** This new tool enables interaction with the Anthropic Claude API.  It provides functions for: counting tokens in messages, extracting completions from responses, handling streaming responses, and querying the API in both synchronous and asynchronous manners. This tool requires the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
*   **Audio Script Refactoring:** The `mike.py` and `speak.py` scripts were moved to a dedicated `audio` directory, improving project organization.  `mike.py` transcribes speech from a microphone using Whisper, and `speak.py` provides text-to-speech functionality. Also, created `toggle-mic.sh` in the same folder to mute/unmute the microphone using `amixer`.
*   **Chat API client and server:**  Implemented `chat/chat-2.py` to use the core server `core.sh`. `chat/chat-3.py` is the server that watches directories using `inotify` and queues requests for core.
*   **Code Summary Tools:** The focus was on creating tools for NetLogo code, specifically for generating documentation. This was to help with my sister's work. Scripts were created to split NetLogo files into individual procedures (`code-summary/netlogo-split.sh`), determine dependencies between procedures using topological sorting (`code-summary/netlogo-tsort.sh`), and create markdown summaries of each procedure using GPT (`code-summary/netlogo-describe.sh` and `code-summary/netlogo-function-summary.sh`). Additionally a `doc-in-original-order.sh` to create a formatted document with a summary and documentation of the program functions.
*   **Embedded Interpreters in C:** Began experimenting with embedding scripting languages within C programs. Makefiles and source code examples (`c/test_*.c`) were created for embedding Lua, Mozilla JavaScript (MozJS), Perl, Python 3.10, QuickJS, Ruby, and V8.
*   **Environment and File Location Changes:** Added a `PYTHONPATH` to `env.sh`.
*   **Integration of chat API with voice chat:** Switched the voice chat scripts from direct calls to `barbarella.py` to use the new chat API.
