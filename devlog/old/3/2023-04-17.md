### Devlog: Week of 2023-04-17 to 2023-04-23

**Summary:**

*   Implemented local Allemande user management scripts.
*   Worked on the voice chat scripts, including fixing an error with mike.py, where it was outputting too much information to stderr.
*   Added whisper.cpp support.
*   Started working on the WebUI, including the backend (chat-api.py) and a basic HTML/CSS/JS setup.  Implemented bb2html.py to translate BB files to HTML format.
*   Created `atail.py` for asynchronously tailing files in Python and a `go/atail.go` equivalent.
*   Added the concept of Allemande "core" services, running separate `llm_llama.py` and `stt_whisper.py` processes.
*   Created a Makefile to simplify launching the core services and associated components.

**Details:**

This week has been pretty busy, with a lot of focus on setting up a good foundation for user management, system services, and the new web UI.

I started by implementing a few essential admin scripts (`allemande-install`, `allemande-uninstall`, `allemande-user-add`). These scripts let you set up the Allemande user, create the necessary directories (ports, models), and manage user-specific configurations. This sets the stage for a multi-user environment.

I also cleaned up the `mike.py` script (for voice input). It was spamming stderr with a bunch of unnecessary output. I wrapped the microphone opening in a context manager to redirect the stderr, and added a debug flag that disables the redirection, making debugging easier.  Also fixed an import, and general polishing.

On Monday, I also added support for `whisper.cpp` by adding a simple `whisp` script. It essentially tries to run `whisper` command, and if that fails, tries running `whisper.cpp` locally.

The bulk of the week has been on the web UI. I started with `chat-api.py`, a basic Starlette app that handles user authentication and posting messages.  I also created an initial HTML/CSS/JS structure in the `webui/static` directory, focusing on the chat interface.  A key piece of this is `bb2html.py` which translates chat logs in `.bb` (Barbarella) format to HTML dynamically. This is used to display the chat history in the web UI. This involved creating a bunch of new scripts for this. Also got rid of some debugging print statements and cleaned up logging.

I wanted a `tail -f` that was guaranteed to work with logs and chat files. So I also built `atail.py` which is a pure Python implementation of `tail -f` that uses `aionotify` to avoid re-reading the entire file when it's modified.  I also wrote a `go/atail.go` equivalent that doesn't have any external dependencies. Also fixed some bugs in `akeepalive.py` while working on this task.

I also decided to separate the main LLM and STT processes to "core" processes, managed in the background. I added corresponding `llm_llama.py` and `stt_whisper.py` scripts, and a `core.sh` script to launch them.

I also needed to make sure these services could access the right models and directories. Also added logging to the server so I can see what's going on, fixed bugs and refactored.

Finally, on Sunday, I tidied everything up and created a Makefile.  The Makefile is mainly a convenience for launching different combinations of processes. Then added a little bit of documentation.

Also got everything integrated and running in voice-chat mode, which is great. I'm using the web UI to chat with the bot, and the voice chat is updating the chat files in real-time.

I'm pretty happy with the progress this week. The structure is now cleaner, and it's easier to manage and extend the different parts of the system.

Also updated requirements.txt.

I didn't take any time off this week, unfortunately!
