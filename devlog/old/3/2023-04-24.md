**Devlog Entry: Week of 2023-04-24 to 2023-04-30**

**Summary:**

*   Created scripts to clean up the Allemande spool directory, removing old request directories to save space.
*   Continued work on the multi-user chat functionality, focusing on voice integration and web UI.
*   Implemented an initial web UI install script, to setup proper permissions and nginx configuration.
*   Began adding scripts for video capturing using OpenCV (Work in Progress).
*   Took some time off during the week.

**Details:**

This week was a bit of a mixed bag, and I took a couple of days off.

I started the week off by tackling some cleanup tasks. I added a couple of scripts, `spool-cleanup` and `spool-history-rm`, to clear out old request directories from the Allemande spool directory. These scripts find and delete directories that match certain patterns. This helps keep things tidy and prevents the spool directory from filling up with old, unused data.

A fair amount of time was spent on the chat system, focusing on multi-user support and integrating voice. I was working on the `chat/brain.sh` script, which is responsible for deciding which agent should respond to a message. I also made some improvements in the user experience: The microphone should stay off when it's not in use (nice for privacy!), and there was some tweaking of the `mike.py` script, to get the voice input working smoothly and with better defaults. The `filter-speech.pl` corrects a few things before speech synthesis.

I did a few things to get the web UI running, and created `webui-install` and `webui-uninstall` scripts for automated deployment. These set the correct file permissions for the web app, and to setup and remove nginx configuration files. I fixed a bug in the sync-project script.

Also, I'm now setting up a basic web UI for it behind nginx.

I began working on some video-related scripts using OpenCV. I added initial versions of `video-capture-cv2.py` and `video-play-cv2.py`. These scripts are just experimental.

Finally, I renamed "Barbarella" to "Allemande", and have attempted to clean out all references to Barbarella from the config, in case any got left behind. The tool used for converting chat logs to HTML is still called "bb2html.py".
