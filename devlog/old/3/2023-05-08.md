**Devlog Entry: 2023-05-08 to 2023-05-14**

This week was a busy one! We had a lot of work going on, across a few different areas, but it all feels like it's building towards a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. I definitely took a day off too, maybe the Thursday, to recharge, so things slowed down a bit then.

**Summary:**

*   **Infrastructure Improvements:**  Tweaked the install/uninstall scripts for Allemande, including Cron jobs. Also refactored how nginx is configured and added a new `pro` service.
*   **Ally Chat Theme Refactor:** Started cleaning up the CSS theming system, making it more robust and easier to manage.
*   **Video-to-Flashcards Enhancement:**  Improved the video-to-flashcards tool, including caching, better text processing, and a demo setup.
*   **Chat Brain Updates:**  Made adjustments to how the chat brain works, including giving it the ability to access roles from the chat history.
*	**Gradio Experiments:** Integrated the Gradio library to provide a web based UI for command line scripts like `wc -l` and `video-to-flashcards`.
*   **Minor Bug Fixes and Cleanups:** A bunch of smaller fixes, mostly related to paths and config defaults.

**Elaborations:**

*   **Infrastructure Improvements:** The `allemande-install` and `allemande-uninstall` scripts got some love. The install now sets up a symlink from `/opt/allemande` to `$ALLEMANDE_HOME`. It also adds a cron job for theme management and chat rotation. The uninstall now removes the Allemande user and the cron job, along with `$ALLEMANDE_PORTS`.  Also Sam updated the nginx configuration, adding support for a new "pro" service, which will likely be some kind of paid offering. This involved creating a new nginx config file specifically for `pro`, and modifying the `haproxy.cfg` to include routes for `pro.allemande.ai` and `pro-local.allemande.ai`.

*   **Ally Chat Theme Refactor:** This took a good chunk of time.  The old CSS system was a bit messy, with a bunch of different theme files and a lot of duplicated code.  The first step was renaming everything from "styles" to "themes" to provide a clearer abstraction, and then creating a new `styles.css` file to hold the code that needs to remain constant, no matter the theme. A `template.css` was created as a base theme and a few new theme were added.
*	  Lots of smaller features and updates in the Ally Chat WebUI, such as better file parsing, and new themes.

*   **Video-to-Flashcards Enhancement:**  This tool is starting to shape up! It now downloads a video, extracts the audio, transcribes it using Whisper, and then uses an LLM to generate flashcards from the transcript. A new `flashcards-demo` subproject was also added. The `video-to-flashcards-cached` script now deletes empty files and other small improvements.

*   **Chat Brain Updates:** The biggest change here was adding `get_roles_from_history` to chat/conductor.py, which allows the chat AI to figure out the user and bot names from the conversation history.

*   **Gradio Experiments:** Trying out the Gradio UI library. It allows the command line scripts to be exposed to a simple web based UI, allowing better testing and use. Includes a `runner.py` script that sets up the Gradio interface, and wrapper scripts (`runner.sh` and `runner-dev.sh`) to run it.

*   **Minor Bug Fixes and Cleanups:**
    *   Fixed a `ValueError` in `chat.py` related to invalid message lines (missing colons).
    *   Sanitized filenames and pathnames throughout the codebase for security reasons.
    *   Added default values in the config.

It's great to see so many areas of the project advancing simultaneously!
