## Devlog: Week of 2023-05-15 to 2023-05-21

**Summary:**

*   Added IP banning functionality to Nginx, integrated with Fail2ban.
*   Worked on Webchat user management scripts and logout functionality.
*   Introduced the "Ikigai" app for resume improvement with some nice visualization.
*   Improved command line tools with new helper scripts for AI model interaction and code explanation.
*   Fixed and enhanced pre-existing AI models, such as Claude.
*   Other bug fixes and improvements.

**Elaboration:**

This week has been pretty busy. A major focus was on beefing up the site's security by implementing IP banning using Fail2ban and integrating it with Nginx. The changes include a new `nginx-ban.conf` action in Fail2ban to automatically update an `banned_ips.conf` file. The nginx configuration checks against this file and redirects banned IPs to a `ban.html` page to show a more clear message. I also created an Allemande specific jail configuration for `nginx-http-auth` to reduce the rate of false positives from http basic auth (which we were having problems with). There was also some refactoring to move the various nginx `site` configs in `/etc/nginx` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available` (with corresponding symlinks in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`, and then reload Nginx using `systemctl restart nginx`.

I also spent time on the Ally Chat web app, specifically focused on the logout process. The logout location was moved from `/logout` to `/logout/logout`, and the nginx config was updated accordingly. Plus some changes in nginx, such as the addition of `proxy_bind $host:$server_port;`. I added a new bash script `webchat-user` to the `adm/` directory that can be used to add, remove, enable, disable, and change passwords for webchat users in the `.htpasswd` file used for basic authentication.

A new app "Ikigai" was developed. This app aims to help users improve their resumes by exploring their sense of purpose. It involves asking the user questions to find their ikigai. A Makefile was created to handle the different stages of the process. Also created a basic `ikigai.html` page with circles for visualization. The goal is to provide useful information and insights for resume improvement.

There were various command-line tool improvements. Several new helper scripts (`1s`, `1sf`, `1w`, `1wf`, `process`, `query`, `yn`, and `ynf`) were added to the `llm/` directory to simplify interactions with language models. The `code-explain` script was also added, which aims to provide brief explanations of code for experienced developers. Also, there was a change to the default mode for `llm process` script to `4` to use GPT-4 model.

I have done some work on Claude, specifically adding support for the 100k token model - the available token limit is now dynamically adjusted depending on the model. I also added a retry function to the llm.py library, and added bard chatbot support, and created the `google/bard.py` for the bard chatbot integration, using an unofficial API.

Finally, in items/src/routes/Kanban.svelte, items can now be dragged between columns to change their state, along with fetch error handling.

There were some additions to the READMEs in the `doc/` directory to document known issues with the AI models overusing hashtags.

Hopefully, I didn't miss anything that isn't evident in the code.
