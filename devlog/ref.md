## Reference for writing style

**Shiny profile cards are now shinier in Ally Chat...**
I was joking that I might sell packs of profile cards, like Pokemon or Magic cards. But I might actually do it. The app is free, but I gotta make money somehow.

**Any math nerd with a clue can figure out how to divide by zero:**
b = a/0 <=> a = 0
The long version:
1. not every expression has exactly 1 value.
2. a/0 has no value when a != 0
3. a/0 has any value when a == 0
So b = a/0 implies that a = 0, and b is not constrained.

**Apparently it's retro-day today on my wacky chat app.**
I know this looks kind of bogus, BUT you can't do this shit in any other chat app:
- group chat with multiple AIs (Gemini, GPT 4, and Perplexity Sonar shown here)
- advanced AI art tools, including regional prompting
- AI vision with multiple models (Claude, Gemini, GPT 4)
- markdown, HTML, JavaScript directly in chat (also TeX, graphviz, etc)
- JS for the image text overlay and the snow was created by Claude directly in the app
- search engines direct in chat (YouTube here, can play music/video)
- a wide range of themes, and custom themes, BYO CSS
- chat privately, or with other humans too (not shown here)

**When AI Plays Along: The Problem of Language Models Enabling Delusions**
Did a little experiment with several AI models, agents and characters, on the topic of LLMs enabling delusions. This is pretty well-known, but I thought it would be interesting to explore it a little.
At the end, all the models reviewed what we did.
I enjoyed quite a few laughs along the way.

**Current AI can already do almost anything a human office worker, writer, artist, or musician can do.** In many cases to a higher standard, and always much faster and cheaper.
This is more than a fancy tool that changes everyone's lives. This is a catastrophic revolution which suddenly displaces humanity from "most intelligent", puts almost everyone out of work, and will necessarily completely change our economy and way of life.

**My take on vibe coding:** Giving a mentally challenged muggle access to powerful AI coding tools is like giving a toddler a jack hammer to play with. Strong LLMs can do a pretty decent job at managing projects, designing architectures, reviewing and correcting code. Most of those are easier than writing code.

**Developing CZ, a dialect of C that looks like Python**
C is a great all-purpose language, but the code is uglier than Python code. CZ has all of the features of C, and translates cleanly into C. Key features:
- Python-like syntax with indentation for blocks
- Fast, lightweight coroutines
- Hygienic macros safer than C preprocessor
- Platform-specific library handling

**Chrome memory abuse**
Chrome's memory usage is fscking ridiculous. 150MB per tab is way too much. Personally I strongly dislike "virtual memory" swapping to disk. I'd much rather get a "out of memory" error than have the computer grind to a halt.

**Fight Back against universal surveillance**
We do not need our government to spy on us all the time. Given the tools, any muppet can use crypto that no system could break, and it's no great inconvenience. If enough people do this, big brother's "intelligence" unit will not have so much power to control us.

**On Data Formats**
Plain, Simple, "key: value" text files are the best format for nearly everything. Not CSV, not SEXPS, not gzipped XML (spit), not binary bitblob monstrosities. Simple records of key value pairs.

## Description of my style
- Analytical, precise, but with accessible explanations
- Blunt and occasionally profane
- Humorous, sometimes cutting or sarcastic
- Politically outspoken about fairness, transparency, privacy
- Not afraid to call out stupidity or corruption
- Technical topics receive deep-dive attention
- Passion for open systems, open formats, empowerment of users

## Suggestions to improve
- Start with clear thesis statements
- Support claims with evidence
- Use consistent formatting and tone
- Break into digestible sections
- Include actionable takeaways

## Final notes
- Preserve lively sense of humour and grumpiness
- Reduce self-centered writing style
