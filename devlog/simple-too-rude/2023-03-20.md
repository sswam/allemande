### **Making AI tools less of a pain in the ass.**
This week was about two things: making the Alpaca weight reconstruction faster, and starting work on a new assistant script that doesn't suck.

**Putting all your CPU cores to work.**
The old `decrypt.py` script was slow as hell. It used one CPU core, leaving the rest of your expensive processor sitting idle. I added multiprocessing support, so now it uses all available cores to get the job done. Instead of one guy doing all the work, you get a whole team. It's massively faster.

On top of that, the README now has checksums for all the important files. No more guessing if your download is busted. You can verify the encrypted files, the original LLaMA weights, and your final decrypted result. I also added hardware requirements, so you know if your rig (like a 3060) has enough VRAM before you start.

**Building a smarter, more configurable AI sidekick.**
I got tired of the clunky ways to chat with local models, so I forked point-alpaca and started a new `assistant.py` script. The goal is a clean, powerful interface that's easy to customize.

Key features so far:
- **No more reloading the same model.** It loads a model once and caches it, saving you a ton of time.
- **Stops the AI from getting amnesia.** The script tracks conversation length (tokens) to keep it from running out of memory and forgetting what you were just talking about.
- **Tuning knobs for creativity.** You can easily tweak generation parameters like `temperature`, `top_k`, etc., from the command line or a clean YAML config file. No more editing the source code for a simple change.
- **Proper Python module.** It was renamed to `assistant.py` so it can be used as a proper module for testing or integration, not just a one-off script.

Plus the usual round of bug fixes and tweaks. The boring but necessary stuff.
