### This week, I gave the AI a voice (and a brain upgrade).

This was a big week. The project went from a silent text-based tool to a proper voice assistant, and the underlying GPT tooling got a massive overhaul. This stuff is moving from a toy project to a genuinely powerful assistant, capable of practical work.

*   **Making it talk.** The main goal was getting voice chat working. I wired up a simple pipeline: `mike.py` for speech-to-text (using the much-improved `whisper-large` model), which feeds the text to the AI, whose response is then piped into a `speak.py` script for text-to-speech. Spent a shitload of time just getting the voice to sound right. I also renamed the main `assistant` script to `barbarella.py`, because why not.

*   **Smarter tools, not just more tools.** The old GPT scripts were a mess. I threw out the clunky `gpt_process` and replaced it with a much cleaner `gpt` module. I then built a whole suite of specialized tools on top of it for common tasksâ€”debugging code, creating summaries, generating flashcards, and even "insanifying" text for fun. The whole system was also upgraded to use `GPT-4`, and the difference in quality is night and day.

*   **New tricks with video and images.** I hacked together a simple pipeline using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` that lets you feed it a YouTube video and have it spit out a summary or flashcards. I also built a new OCR tool that uses Tesseract to read text from images, then has GPT-4 clean up the garbage results Tesseract inevitably produces.

This was a ton of work, but it laid the foundation for more advanced AI interactions. Integrating voice and video processing with a much smarter set of tools makes the whole thing feel alive.
