### **Spring Cleaning the Codebase & Adding a New Brain (Claude)**

A project is like a workshop. If your tools are scattered everywhere, you can't build shit. This week was a massive, badly needed spring cleaning. We stopped dumping everything in the root directory and created proper homes for our services. It's not glamorous work, but it means we can find things and build faster without tripping over our own feet.

Along the way, we plugged in a new AI and built some sharp new tools for understanding code.

**Finally, Some Fscking Organization**
The biggest effort was just taming the chaos. We moved a ton of scattered files into dedicated directories:
*   Core services now live in `core/`.
*   All voice chat code is now in `voice-chat/`.
*   Code analysis tools were moved to `code/` and `code-summary/`.
*   Interpreter experiments were consolidated into `c/`.

We also refactored a lot of the core scripts to use our `Llama` classes. This isn't just about tidiness; it makes the code cleaner, more efficient, and a hell of a lot faster.

**Plugging in the Claude API**
More brains are better. We built a new library to talk directly to the Anthropic Claude API, one of the most capable models out there. Now we have a clean, simple way to send queries and stream responses from Claude, opening up a ton of new possibilities for agents and analysis.

**Smarter Tools for Voice and Code**
*   **Voice Chat:** Fixed some annoying invitation bugs. More importantly, we disabled the hyperactive "emo mode" by default, so the AI won't spam you with emojis anymore. We even saved a screenshot of the bug for posterity.
*   **Code Whisperer:** You can't have an AI assistant that doesn't understand code. We built a new suite of tools that can read a codebase (starting with NetLogo), split it into individual functions, and generate a plain English summary of what each part does. This is the first step toward an AI that can document and review an entire project.

**Odds and Ends: Better Tooling, Less Grunt Work**
*   **Syncing Sanity:** Wrote an admin script (`sync-project`) to automate the tedious and error-prone job of merging and syncing code across different branches. Less time fighting with Git, more time building.
*   **Embedded Languages:** Started laying the groundwork to embed interpreters like Python, Lua, Ruby, and QuickJS directly in our C code. This gives us massive flexibility for adding features without reinventing the wheel.
*   **Modern Models:** Added a script to convert models to the `safetensors` format. Itâ€™s safer and is quickly becoming the standard, so we're staying ahead of the curve.
