### **Devlog: Plugging Holes and Polishing the Engine**

Another week of wrestling the Allemande toolkit into shape. The focus was on making things safer, smarter, and easier to actually run without tearing your hair out. A lot of plumbing and foundational work.

*   **Smarter Speech-to-Text with a C++ Fallback.**
	Not everyone has the standard Python `whisper` installed or wants the overhead. The toolkit now tries to use it, but if it's missing, it intelligently falls back to the `whisper.cpp` version. It’s a faster, lighter C++ implementation. No more excuses for not having transcription.

*   **Preventing JavaScript Shenanigans in Markdown.**
	Markdown is great, but letting users embed raw HTML is just asking for trouble. Any muppet could drop a `<script>` tag and create chaos. I'm now forcing all markdown through `pandoc` with a custom Lua filter that aggressively strips out any malicious crap. You can format your text, but you can't hack the system through a chat message.

*   **A Better `tail -f` for Asynchronous Code.**
	I needed a way to "follow" a stream of data asynchronously, like `tail -f` does for files. The new Python and Go utilities do just that. Crucially, they're smart enough to not have a seizure and rewind to the beginning if the source file gets truncated—a common and annoying failure in simpler scripts.

*   **The UI Finally Talks to the Brain.**
	The web UI is no longer a pretty, disconnected facade. It's now properly wired into the core AI services and voice chat. I wrote a central `allemande.py` library to handle the communication, so we don't have a dozen different bespoke ways for components to talk to each other. One simple, sane API to rule them all, following the "simple text formats are best" philosophy.

*   **One `Makefile` to Run It All.**
	The old method of launching the app with a collection of random shell scripts was garbage. I threw them out and replaced the whole mess with a single `Makefile`. Now, `make services` or `make webui` does the job. It's cleaner, more reliable, and how it should have been from the start.

*   **General Housekeeping and Bug Squashing.**
	The usual weekly chores. Fixed some OCR glitches, removed annoying log spam from the microphone process (it's still there if you need it with the `--debug` flag), and added some banner images for a little flair.
