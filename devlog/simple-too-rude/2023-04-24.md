### **Herding AI Cats: A New Conductor and a Lot of Janitorial Work**

A lot of this week felt like digital janitorial work. It's not glamorous, but if you don't sweep the floors and organize the tools, the whole workshop grinds to a halt. The goal was to fight code rot, make the system easier to manage, and lay the groundwork for smarter AI.

**Whipping the Scripts into Shape**
First, I went after the mess of setup scripts. Instead of having the same "are you root?" check copied and pasted everywhere, it's now centralized. Why write the same code twice? New, simple scripts for installing the web UI and cleaning out old temp files (`spool`) will hopefully make server management less of a headache. Simple, boring, but necessary.

**Voice Chat & Web UI Fixes**
Voice chat got a few quality-of-life bumps. You can now toggle your mic with a script that pops up a notification, so you're not left wondering if you're muted. We're also filtering the text sent to the speech synthesizer better, which should lead to less robotic-sounding nonsense. Behind the scenes, I ripped out some old module dependencies to make the code cleanerâ€”the kind of refactoring that users don't see but prevents future meltdowns.

**The AI Conductor (Work in Progress)**
The most interesting new piece is the "Conductor." The idea is to have a master process that intelligently directs traffic between different AI agents in a chat. Think of it as an orchestral conductor, telling the GPT-4 violin section when to play and the local Llama model when to pipe down. It's early days, but this is the foundation for creating much more complex and coordinated AI interactions instead of just having a bunch of bots shouting into the same room.

**Other Housekeeping**
Finally, the project is now set up to use `screen` for managing processes, with a few helper scripts to make it less of a pain. And the README actually has screenshots now, so it looks slightly less like a madman's manifesto.
