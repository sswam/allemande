### Devlog: Spring Cleaning and Future-Proofing

This week was all about getting the house in order and preparing for the future. A lot of behind-the-scenes work to make the Allemande project more robust, easier to use, and not tied to any single tech giant. Also, first steps on some cool new features.

**Ditching the GPT Monoculture for a Multi-LLM Future**
I'm not about to get locked into a single AI provider, so I'm making the project model-agnostic. The `openai` directory has been renamed to `llm` to reflect this reality. All the scripts that used to have "gpt" in the name now have a more generic "llm" prefix. To prove the point, I've added initial support for Anthropic's Claude models. Now you can use either, and the system won't care. This is how it should be.

**Getting Ready for Prime Time: Web Server Grunt Work**
A web app isn't much use if it only runs on my machine. I spent a good chunk of time wrestling with Nginx and HAProxy configurations to get things ready for a proper deployment. This is the unglamorous but necessary work of setting up subdomains like `chat.allemande.ai`, handling SSL, and making sure the right bits are password-protected. I also streamlined the install/uninstall scripts so setting up the web UI isn't a total nightmare.

**Making Voice Chat Not Suck**
Fixed one of the most annoying things in any voice chat app: the app hearing itself talk and creating a feedback loop. I added logic to mute the microphone when the text-to-speech is active. Made the whole process thread-safe with a lock, because race conditions are a pain I don't need. Also tweaked the mic confidence threshold to hopefully get cleaner transcriptions.

**A First Peek at the Graph Editor**
Started noodling on a visual graph editor that will live inside Ally Chat. It's very early days—mostly just an HTML file (`graph/svg-editor.html`) and some experiments—but the goal is to let you build and edit complex diagrams and mind maps without ever leaving the chat interface.

**Housekeeping and Other Goodies**
*   **Project Bling:** The GitHub repos for Allemande and Barbarella now have shiny new banner images and clearer `README` files. First impressions matter.
*   **The Roadmap:** Created a `projects.md` file to lay out what's being built and what's coming next. A little transparency goes a long way.
*   **Tooling Up:** Added a whole suite of little utilities for wrangling tabular data (TSV, CSV, HTML, you name it) and a bunch of helper scripts for managing my i3 window manager setup, because a developer's workflow should be as frictionless as possible.
