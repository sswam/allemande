### Devlog: Week of 2023-05-08

This week, we made Ally Chat prettier and smarter. The focus was on giving users more control over the look and feel, while also beefing up the backend for voice chat and adding a proper UI for the new video-to-flashcards feature. And, of course, the usual janitorial work of fixing bugs and cleaning up code.

**Pimp Your Chat: More Themes, Less Ugly**
Most chat apps have one, maybe two themes, and they're usually boring. We think you should be able to make your chat look however you want. This week we added a bunch of new themes (dark-rainbow, nature, autumn) and made it dead simple to apply them. You can even get a random theme every time you log in by running `tools/user-set-theme.py -f`. It's all just CSS, so if you don't like ours, you can bring your own. We also tweaked Nginx to handle the theme files correctly so it all just works.

**Smarter Voice Chat That Actually Listens**
Voice chat can be janky. We made ours a little less so by fine-tuning the microphone confidence threshold, so it's better at knowing when you're actually talking. For the output, speech synthesis can now use your GPU (via CUDA support in `audio/speak.py`), which makes it a hell of a lot faster. We're also continuing to integrate `whisper.cpp` to serve as a more robust speech recognition backend.

**Turn YouTube Videos into Study Notes, Now With a UI**
The video-to-flashcards feature is a killer app, but it was a command-line-only affair. Not anymore. We built a simple web interface (`video-to-flashcards-webui.py`) using Gradio, so now you can just paste a video URL and get your study notes. Behind the scenes, we refactored the whole pipeline to be more reliable and clean up after itself, so it's less likely to crap out and leave garbage files behind.

**The Janitorial Work: Infrastructure and Bug Squashing**
A lot of work this week was the unglamorous but necessary stuff.
*   We added a `cron` job to rotate chat logs so they don't consume the whole disk.
*   A bunch of simple `git` wrapper scripts were added to make our own lives easier.
*   We squashed a number of bugs, from silly indentation errors to annoying Gradio deprecation warnings that cluttered the logs. You can't build a cathedral on a swamp.
