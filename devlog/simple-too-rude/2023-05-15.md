### **Devlog: Drag-and-Drop, Ban Hammers, and a Zillion New AI Toys**

Busy week. Fixed some things that should have worked already, and built a bunch of new tools because I can. The focus was on making things more intuitive, more powerful, and better defended against the script kiddies of the world.

**The Kanban Board Is Now Less Annoying**
You can now drag and drop items between columns on the Kanban board. It's a basic feature that should have been there from the start, but now it is. Moving a task from "To Do" to "Done" is as simple as clicking and dragging it. I also added proper error handling, so if an API call fails, the app will actually tell you instead of just silently failing like a coward.

**An Arsenal of New AI Command-Line Tools**
I went a little nuts creating new AI tools this week. Most of these are designed for the command line, because GUIs are for chumps.
*   **Chat from your editor:** A new script (`llm-chat-ed`) lets you chat with LLMs directly from your text editor. No more context switching.
*   **No-BS code explanations:** The `code-explain` tool gives you a concise explanation of a code block, targeted at devs who already know what they're doing and just need a quick hint.
*   **Quick-draw wrappers:** Added a bunch of shell scripts (`gpt4`, `claude+`, etc.) as shortcuts for my favorite models and modes. Less typing is more living.
*   **One-word answers:** A suite of tiny "query" scripts for when you just need a single word or a simple "yes/no" from a multi-trillion parameter model.
*   **Better Bard integration:** Wrote a proper Python wrapper for Google's Bard API that can save and resume conversations. Also made the core `llm.py` script more robust with automatic retries.

**Fighting Back Against Bots with the Ban Hammer**
I've had enough of malicious bots hammering the server. I set up a simple, effective security system using Fail2ban and Nginx. Here's how it works:
1.  Fail2ban watches server logs for suspicious activity, like repeated failed login attempts from the same IP.
2.  If an IP is naughty, Fail2ban adds it to a blacklist.
3.  Nginx checks that list on every request. If the IP is on it, it gets redirected to a polite-but-firm `ban.html` page instead of the real site.
Simple, clean, and automated. If you're a bot, get off my lawn.

**Housekeeping and Other Fixes**
*   **Ikigai App:** The resume improvement app got some tune-ups, including backups and a new HTML visualization for the Ikigai concept.
*   **Logout Actually Works:** The logout button now, you know, logs you out. Revolutionary stuff. Also updated the user management script.
*   **Website Polish:** Tweaked some CSS on the homepage because misaligned buttons are an offense against nature.
