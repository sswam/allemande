### **Ally Chat gets a ton of upgrades, and a new coat of paint.**
My wacky chat app is a little less wacky this week. The goal is to make it the most powerful chat platform on the planet, and that means fixing the janky parts and adding more firepower.

*   **More AI, better integration:** Juggled the AI models, adding support for Claude Instant with its massive 100k context window. I also refactored the agent code so it's easier to manage the growing stable of AIs.
*   **A fresh look:** Added a slick new black theme and tweaked the CSS so buttons and spacing don't look so amateur.
*   **Basic user management:** The app now checks if a user already exists before adding them. Revolutionary, I know. New users also get a welcome message.
*   **Slapping on some security:** Threw some basic `.htpasswd` authentication on the Nginx config. It's not Fort Knox, but it'll keep the casual riff-raff out.

### **Introducing Alfred, your new document-processing butler.**
I built a new tool named Alfred to be my digital butler for documents. It's for when you have a pile of files and need an AI to make sense of them without a bunch of manual nonsense.

Alfred can take almost anything—text, images, audio, even video—and process it. It can generate summaries, pull out key information, or convert files into different formats. It’s all powered by a `Makefile` and some great open-source tools like `pandoc` and `ffmpeg`, with an LLM for the brains. I gave it a simple web UI so I don't have to live on the command line for everything. The neat part is you can just drop a folder of files with a `mission.txt` file telling the AI what to do, and it zips up the results. Simple, effective.

### **A few new scripts to make life less annoying.**
I hate repetitive tasks, so I wrote some code to automate them away.

*   **`bestov` Album Generator:** A script that asks an AI for an artist's best songs and then goes and rips them from YouTube. Because making playlists by hand is for suckers.
*   **`arcs` Revision Control:** A system to sync code with a specific list of peers defined in your git config. A simpler way to push and pull without all the ceremony.
*   **`giles` Search Utility:** Automates searching the web, scraping pages, and feeding them to Alfred for a summary. Why read ten articles when an AI can do it for you?

### **And a bunch of other odds and ends.**
The usual weekly grind of small fixes and infrastructure tweaks.

*   **Speech-to-text everywhere:** Built a script that lets you press F2 on any webpage to dictate text directly into whatever you have focused. Surprisingly useful.
*   **Security theater:** Started setting up Fail2ban to automatically ban misbehaving IPs. The internet is a jungle.
*   **New look and feel:** The whole site got a facelift with new favicons and CSS rules. It's still my weird corner of the internet, but now it's a slightly prettier one.
