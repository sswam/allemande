### A Week of Mad Science: New AI Agents, Better Tools, and Wrestling with WordPress

Another week, another ton of code. Significant progress on Ally Chat, my command-line tools, and the eternal battle with WordPress integration. Lots of cleanup, but a good pile of new features, too.

**Expanding the AI Asylum in Ally Chat**
The main chat platform got a few new personalities. I added "Bilda," a build-bot that speaks GNU Make, for automating dev tasks right in the chat window. I also added "Barbie," for... reasons. More importantly, I fixed the command parser using `shlex`, so my scripts finally stop choking on weirdly quoted arguments.

**Forging Better Weapons for the Command Line**
I got tired of repetitive tasks, so I built a bunch of new tools to handle the tedious crap. This includes scripts for:
- Slugifying strings (making clean URLs).
- Ripping titles from HTML files.
- A faster `find` command that's smart enough to ignore garbage like `node_modules` and `.git` directories.
- Simple utilities to hide and unhide files.

**Taming the WordPress Beast**
Getting my content onto WordPress without it looking like a mess is an ongoing project. This week, I gave my scripts full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) powers over posts and pages via the API. The system can now suck sections out of my local Markdown files and slap them into a WordPress post while keeping a unified look. It also handles uploading images, including 2K versions.

**Janitorial Duty: Squashing Bugs and Cleaning Up My Own Mess**
A lot of time was spent on unglamorous but necessary fixes.
- **Dumb Name Clash:** Turns out, some genius on PyPI already made a package called `slugify`. My script is now `sl_gify` to avoid conflicts. Problem solved.
- **LLM Reliability:** Implemented exponential backoff for remote LLM calls. If an AI doesn't answer, my script will now try again, but it'll chill out a bit longer each time instead of hammering the server like an idiot. I also taught the code how to not have a meltdown when Claude chokes on a super long prompt.
- **Digital Feng Shui:** Did a bunch of refactoring, renaming folders and moving functions around. A clean workshop is a productive workshop, or so they say.

**The Website Got a Facelift (and a Price Tag)**
The front-end got some love. New favicons, fonts, CSS... the usual tune-up to make things look less like they were designed by a programmer in a basement. (Even though they were.)

I also added proper pricing plans. Yes, there's a free tier, so you can play around without selling a kidney.
