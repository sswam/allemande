### Devlog: Automating Everything, One Annoying Task at a Time

This week was all about making the machines do more of the boring work. I spent time refining the AI tools, automating the content pipeline from web scraping to WordPress publishing, and generally cleaning up the digital workshop.

**Making the AI assistants less dumb**
Not every task needs a sledgehammer. You don't use a massive, expensive AI model to write a one-sentence summary any more than you'd use a cannon to kill a fly. I've now set things up so our tools can pick the right brain for the job—a smaller, faster model for quick tasks, and a bigger one for heavy-duty analysis. This saves time and money. I also improved the script that uses an AI to write Git commit messages, because who has time for that? And added a simple script for stripping silence out of audio files, a boring but necessary step before transcription.

**Automating the Content Grind**
The whole point of our digital assistant, Giles, is to be a research assistant that doesn't complain. This week, I beefed up its ability to fetch content from the web, making it smarter about file types and less likely to choke on garbage. The scripts that automatically gather data for specific topics (like tourism or industry reports) got a major tune-up. The goal: feed it a list of topics, and get back structured, summarized documents without all the manual copy-pasting nonsense.

**Streamlining the WordPress Pipeline**
Getting content *into* WordPress can be a real pain in the ass. I fixed up the automation script that uploads everything—posts, images, the whole lot—to prevent it from tripping over itself. The system is now more robust, making it easier to go from a raw idea to a published post with minimal human intervention.

**Squashing Bugs and General Housekeeping**
A lot of this week was spent on less glamorous work: fixing things that were broken and cleaning up code. I made the AI tools more resilient, so they don't crash when you feed them a ridiculously long prompt or empty input. A bunch of little helper scripts were added or fixed to make life easier on the command line, from forcing a Git pull to fixing a weird screen bug in WSL. It's the digital equivalent of oiling the gears—not exciting, but the machine seizes up without it.
