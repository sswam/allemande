### Putting the Content Mill on Autopilot

Spent the week teaching the machine to do more of the grunt work. The goal is a fully automated content pipeline, from data gathering to publishing, because doing it by hand is a soul-crushing waste of time. No breaks, just code.

**Smarter Content Generation**
The content-gathering scripts got a major tune-up. Instead of dumping everything in one place, they're now smart enough to create dedicated folders for each topic (like industry, tourism, and now books). The machine-generated summaries are also cleaner, using simple bullet points instead of messy paragraphs. It's about forcing the machine to be organized so I don't have to be.

**Making WordPress Less Painful**
Getting content onto the website is now faster. The publishing script was reworked to handle multiple articles in parallel instead of one-by-one, which makes a huge difference. It's also more flexible, letting me swap out formatting templates on the fly. I also added a simple, automated backup system to save all draft posts. Because losing work is for amateurs.

**Intelligent Media Handling**
A few new tools were built to solve common, annoying problems:
*   **YouTube Auto-Categorization:** Wrote a script that reads a video's title and automatically assigns a relevant category. No more manual clicking. It's also smart enough to skip videos that don't seem related to the main topic.
*   **Focal Point Cropping:** A new image tool can intelligently crop pictures around the most important part (the "focal point"). This means better-looking thumbnails without manual editing.
*   **Process Throttling:** Added a simple utility to rein in a resource-hungry process by automatically pausing and resuming it, which is better than just killing it or letting it grind the system to a halt.

**General Cleanup**
The usual round of code cleanup, dependency updates, and bug squashing. It's not glamorous, but it keeps the whole system from turning into a pile of unmaintainable garbage.
