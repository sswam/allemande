### **No Breaks, Just Code: Sharpening Tools and Fixing Stupid Bugs**

Another week, no breaks. Just a caffeine-fueled slog through a mountain of code. The work covered everything from making the web UI less fragile to adding new tools that should have existed ages ago. The goal is always the same: make the system smarter so I don't have to work as hard.

**Making the Content Bots Less Dumb**
Alfred, our content generation bot, can be a bit fragile. A lot of this week was spent making it more robust.

*   **Input Validation:** The web UI will now yell at you if you try to give it empty inputs. A simple concept, but it prevents a whole class of stupid, self-inflicted errors. Garbage in, garbage out.
*   **Better Downloads:** Improved how we handle files downloaded from URLs. It's now smarter about temporary files and even creates `.url` bookmarks, so we don't lose track of where things came from.
*   **Industry Scraping:** Fixed some broken IDs in the `run_industry` script. Still poking at the guts of our web scraper, Giles, to make grabbing industry content less of a manual chore.

**New Tools for Annoying Problems**
Sometimes you have to stop and build the tools you wish you had.

*   **Network Watcher:** A new `net-watch` script to keep an eye on the internet connection. Because sometimes you need to know if it's your code that's broken or just the damn internet again.
*   **Code Formatter:** A `code-style` script to automatically enforce a consistent style. It rewrites other scripts to use a standard format because I'm tired of looking at ugly, inconsistent code.
*   **Table Converter:** A simple script to convert Markdown tables into TSV (Tab-Separated Values). Because wrestling with data inside a Markdown table is a special kind of hell.

**Stopping the Bots from Talking to Themselves Forever**
The chat system is the heart of the project, and it got some much-needed attention.

*   **Local vs. Remote AI:** You can now tell the chat system whether to use a local AI model (running on your PC) or a remote one on the server. Flexibility is key.
*   **Infinite Chat Loop:** Fixed a bug that could cause bots to get stuck in an infinite loop talking to each other. Amusing, but not very productive.
*   **Agent Renaming:** The agent to be removed when not in ADULT mode is now 'Pr0nto' instead of 'pornhub'. A little more discreet, I guess.

**Janitorial Duty and Other Assorted Crap**
Not all work is glamorous. A lot of it is just cleaning up messes.

*   **Mount Script Cleanup:** Refactored the `ally_mount` script, fixing a boneheaded `unmount` vs `umount` typo and making the code less repetitive. Clean code is good code.
*   **Docs:** Added some lists of freelancing sites and money-making ideas to the documentation. Might as well share the research.
*   **Haikus:** Threw in a script that shows how to generate haikus. Because why the hell not?
