### Making the Content Machine Less Dumb

Another week, no breaks. This time was spent beating our content generation system into shape. When you’re building tools to automate industry and tourism content, the goal is to make them smart. Last week, they were being pretty stupid.

**Giles the scraper was being a muppet, so I fixed it.**
Giles is supposed to scrape the web for info and then have an AI summarize it. Simple, right? Except it was grabbing the wrong files, the AI instructions were vague, and it kept losing the damn images.
-   **File Patterns:** It now correctly targets mission files ending in `.txt.in`. Basic stuff that shouldn't have been wrong in the first place.
-   **AI Prompts:** I rewrote the query guides for the AI. If you give a language model vague instructions, you get vague, useless garbage back. Now they’re more specific, so the content is actually focused.
-   **Variables:** Fixed a variable bug that prevented images from being correctly linked to posts. An article about a tourist spot with no picture is pointless.

**Wrestling with WordPress is a necessary evil.**
Getting content *into* WordPress should be painless, but it rarely is. Our `injectify.py` script got some much-needed upgrades to be more flexible. You can now create or update posts without having to specify the `status` every single time. Small change, but it removes a pointless, rigid requirement. We also cleaned up the mission templates to make them consistent. Inconsistent inputs lead to inconsistent outputs.

**If your docs suck, your project sucks.**
I have no patience for projects with bad documentation. It’s lazy and disrespectful to users. We updated the Windows and Debian setup guides to reflect reality, fixing package names and clone commands. If a user can’t even get the thing installed, you’ve already failed.

**A few new tools and a saner way to code.**
-   **Markdown Numbering:** Wrote a simple Perl script to automatically number headings in Markdown files. Manually re-numbering a list of 20 headings after you add one at the top is a special kind of hell I’d like to avoid.
-   **Single-Line Giles:** Added "giles1," a stripped-down script to search and summarize from the command line. For when you need a quick answer and don't want to fire up the whole machine.
-   **Better Code Style:** Pushing a new rule: check for errors and negative conditions first. This flattens out `if/else` pyramids and makes code infinitely easier to read. Deeply nested code is a sign of a deeply troubled mind.
