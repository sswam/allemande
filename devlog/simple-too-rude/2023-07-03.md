**WordPress Templating and the Windows-to-Linux Two-Step**

This week was mostly spent wrestling with the WordPress tourism templates. I ditched the clunky, full-width design for a cleaner single-column layout that's actually readable. Also did a bunch of other small tweaks, like moving the map to sit above the social sharing buttons where it makes more sense.

The most annoying part of this workflow is getting the template code from Windows into my Linux environment (WSL2) for editing. To fix this, I created a dead-simple `tourism_import.txt` file. It's a low-tech but effective workaround: a dedicated file for copy-pasting the template content, so I can use proper tools like `vimdiff` to compare and merge changes without losing my mind.
