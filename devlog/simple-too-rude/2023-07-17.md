### **Making Setup Less of a Dumpster Fire**
I spent most of the week wrestling with our setup process. Getting a new developer or user up and running should be simple, but it's often a painful, error-prone mess. The old way of doing things—a giant `debian.txt` file full of commands to copy-paste—was asking for trouble.

So I broke that monster file into a couple of actual, runnable bash scripts. They now ask you questions and show what they're doing, so you're less likely to screw up your user settings. It also handles the boring stuff like installing the right dependencies, fixing package paths, and getting SSH keys generated and distributed to the servers. I also added some guardrails for Windows users, like how to properly shut up Windows Defender so it doesn't nuke your work.

As part of the cleanup, I temporarily commented out gTTS and Gradio. They were causing trouble and will be dealt with later.

### **A Few More Sharp Tools for the Command Line**
I'm a big believer in the command line, but only if you have good tools that do one thing well. I added a handful of new scripts to make life easier.

*   A set of scripts for finding, inspecting, and editing executables in your PATH (`wich`, `lw`, `cw`, `vw`). No more guessing where a command comes from or what's inside it.
*   A couple of simple Perl scripts for wrangling text files (`uniqoc` to count unique lines, `kut` to slice columns). Plain text is king, and small, sharp tools are why.
*   A few utilities for ripping apart HTML from the command line, like grabbing a page's title.

### **Cleaning Up the Mess**
A few other quick fixes and quality-of-life improvements:

*   Told git to finally ignore all hidden dotfiles. About time.
*   Fixed a stupid path bug in the `llm-git-commit` script so it knows what repository it's in.
*   The web installer now uses the more reliable `service start/stop` commands for Nginx and HAProxy instead of `systemctl restart`. Should be less fragile.
