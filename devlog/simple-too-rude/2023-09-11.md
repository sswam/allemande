### **Building an AI to interview your grandma.**
I started sketching out a new app, codenamed 'Lex'. The initial spark was thinking about how to capture the life stories of elders, but the idea is much bigger. It could be used for anything from running meetings to personal coaching or project planning.

The AI needs to be more than just a chatbot. It should:
*   Work by itself or collaborate with a human interviewer.
*   Know the overall goal of the conversation.
*   Help manage an agenda and keep the interview on track.
*   Use voice chat and know who is speaking.
*   Remember what was said earlier so you don't have to repeat yourself.

The really wild idea is using the LLM to clone an elder's voice and speaking style to create an audiobook of their life, narrated 'by them'. A bit morbid, maybe, but also kind of beautiful. The first brain-dump is in a text file.

### **Making my file finder slightly less dumb.**
My `find-quick` tool was wasting time searching through Python virtual environment (`venv`) directories. These folders are full of thousands of library files that you almost never want to see in a search result.

So, I told it to ignore them. It's a small change, but it's about not being an idiot and wasting cycles searching through junk. The tool is now faster and the results are cleaner.
