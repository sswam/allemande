### Giving the AI a Mission, and other Mad Science

This week was all about teaching the AI new tricks. The main event was wrestling with Anthropic's new API to get Claude 2 working properly, but I also cooked up a new way to give the AI agents a "mission" to keep them on track.

#### Wrangling the new Claude 2 API
Fighting with APIs is half the job. I updated the `claude.py` connector to handle Anthropic's latest changes for Claude 2. This mostly involved pointing the code to the new model and upping the token limitâ€”hopefully to the full 100k, but I still need to test if that breaks older models. I also added some logging configuration to shut up the noisy `httpx` library, which was spamming the console. One of those small fixes that makes life 10% better.

#### Giving the AI a Mission Briefing
I've started feeding the AI "mission files" to give it better context. The idea is simple: if you have a chat file called `my_chat.bb`, the system now looks for a `my_chat.m` file. If it finds one, it prepends that "mission" to the chat history before sending it to the AI. This lets you steer the agent toward a specific goal, like "act as a skeptical editor" or "help me brainstorm sci-fi concepts."

It feels a little bit hacky right now, and there's a known issue where it can send partial messages, but I've put a temporary fix in place. It's a solid first step toward more steerable, purposeful AI agents.

#### Brainstorming the next wave of AI weirdness
Spent some time dreaming up new applications. A few of the more interesting ideas:
*   **AI Legal Assistant:** An agent that drafts legal documents by analyzing a client's goals and relevant laws.
*   **Interactive Fiction Co-writer:** An AI that works with a human author to generate branching narratives and characters on the fly.
*   **AI Nutritionist:** An agent that creates personalized diet plans from genetic data, biometrics, and lifestyle info.

I'm also thinking about making the AI's output more transparent by having it include a confidence score and an outline of its thought process. It's one thing for an AI to give you an answer; it's another for it to show its work.
