### Smarter Summaries and an AI That Can Call 911

This week was all about making the AI smarter and exploring some wild new ideas. The chat summarization got a much-needed brain transplant, and I'm prototyping an AI that can listen for health emergencies.

### Making AI Chat Summaries Less Dumb

My old chat summarization script was pretty basic. The new one is a two-stage process. First, a fast, cheap AI (Claude Instant) whips up a quick summary of new messages. Then, a more powerful AI (Claude) takes that new summary, merges it with the *previous* summary, and reorganizes the whole thing by topic.

The idea is to get a clean, consolidated summary that doesn't repeat itself, without blowing the bank on API calls for every little update. It's still experimental, but it’s already a huge improvement.

### An AI that listens for heart attacks.

I've started mapping out a health monitoring app. It's not a fitness tracker. The concept is an app that listens for signs of genuine distress while you sleep—or even while you're awake. It would use the microphone to detect events like a heart attack, stroke, or a bad fall.

If the app detects a problem and the user doesn't respond to a prompt, it would automatically alert emergency contacts or call for help. A grim topic, but it could be a literal lifesaver.

### Giving My AI an Email Address

Another idea I'm kicking around is full email integration. I want to give AI agents the ability to send and receive emails, acting as actual personal secretaries. Hooking this into something like `libpurple` could eventually let them talk to other chat services, too.

### Cleaning Up the Web's Garbage Before Feeding it to the AI

You can't just feed raw HTML garbage to an LLM and expect a good result. My web-scraping tools (`pandoc-dump`) now clean up the HTML *before* converting it to Markdown, stripping out useless navigation and sidebars first. It's tuned for MediaWiki (like Wikipedia) right now.

I also built a new test script that downloads a webpage and has different AIs (Claude, GPT-4) summarize it. This lets me compare their quality and, more importantly, calculate the token costs. Also tightened up some regex to strip junk from URLs and Markdown links.

### Squashing Bugs and Watching AIs Make Typos

Fixed a stupid bug where one of my scripts was being called twice. I'm also now keeping a running list of GPT-4 making dumb typos in its output. It happens more often than you'd think.
