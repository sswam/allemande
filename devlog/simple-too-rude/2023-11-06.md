### Upgrading the Brain and Fixing the Plumbing

Back in the saddle after two weeks off. This week was all about upgrading Ally Chat's AI, making our services more bulletproof, and cleaning up some messy web content. I also mucked around with haproxy to get a new subdomain routed properly.

**Giving Ally Chat a Bigger Brain with GPT-4 Turbo**
Ally Chat now defaults to the new GPT-4 Turbo model. This keeps us on the bleeding edge, but I'm not locking us in. I added a config override so we can easily test other models. The original "gpt-4" is still available as "gpt-4-orig", and I've staged Claude-2 for future experiments. Itâ€™s all about having the power of the latest models while keeping the freedom to play with whatever we want.

**Making Things Less Likely to Crap Out**
Network calls fail. APIs burp. It happens. To deal with this, I wrote a new asynchronous retry function (`aretry`) in Python. If an operation fails, it automatically tries again a few times before giving up. This should make the whole platform more stable and less prone to random hiccups. If an error is truly unfixable, it'll still fail properly instead of hanging.

**A Bit of Digital Housekeeping**
Spent some time on minor but annoying fixes:
*   **Web Content Cleaning:** Fixed a dumb typo in a regex that was failing to strip out embedded `data:image` URLs from saved web pages. Also tweaked the content extraction to be a bit smarter about finding the main text within `<main>` or `<article>` tags.
*   **HAProxy Routing:** Added the `flipit.allemande.ai` subdomain to our HAProxy config to route traffic to the right backend. Simple, but necessary.
