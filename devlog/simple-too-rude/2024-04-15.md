### **Shaking off the rust after a few months off.**
Hadn't touched the code for a while, so I got back into it this week. Added a couple of new utility scripts, fed GPT-4 more context in Ally Chat, and cleaned up some annoying config issues with HAProxy and my i3 window manager.

### **New toys for data munging.**
Added two handy new scripts to my toolkit:
*   `json2csv.py`: A simple Python script to turn a stream of JSON objects into a clean CSV file. Reads from stdin, writes to stdout. No frills, just gets the job done for quick data analysis.
*   `wikitext-get.sh`: A bash one-liner that scrapes the raw wikitext of any Wikipedia page using their API. Now I can start pulling down data for... reasons.

### **Giving GPT-4 a better memory.**
Doubled the default context for GPT-4 in Ally Chat from 10 lines to 20. More context should mean more coherent conversations from the AI. It's always a trade-off, thoughâ€”more context is better until the API bills start to sting.

### **Some basic housekeeping.**
Did some routine infrastructure work. Added `flipit_dev` and `chatpal` subdomains to the HAProxy config to route traffic for some clients. Straightforward stuff. I also fixed a nagging i3 layout bug where a workspace was misnamed and squashed a typo in the `Makefile` that was breaking my layout. Sanity restored.
