### Ally Chat gets the shiny new GPT-4o. Let's see if it's any good.

This week was all about jamming OpenAI's new GPT-4o model into Ally Chat.

The work itself wasn't rocket science. It was mostly just plumbing: adding the new model ID (`gpt-4o`) and description to the config, then pointing the default "gpt-4" selector to use the new model. Simple enough.

For now, I've set its cost to the same as the old GPT-4, but that's just a placeholder. We'll see what the real damage is later. Everyone's raving about how fast and smart it is, but I'm skeptical, as usual. The real test will be how it holds up in actual chats, not some cherry-picked demo. High hopes, but I'm prepared for disappointment.
