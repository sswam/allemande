### This Week in API Whack-a-Mole

External APIs are flaky. Connections drop, servers hiccup, and companies like OpenAI are constantly changing their code. If your app relies on them, it needs to be tough enough to handle the chaos. This week was all about hardening the Ally Chat backend so it doesn't fall over when someone else’s server has a bad day.

### Keeping Up with the OpenAI Joneses

First, the mandatory API update. OpenAI decided to change how their models are called, so our code had to follow suit. We swapped out the old `openai.ChatCompletion.create` for the new `client.chat.completions.create`. It's the kind of maintenance that's a constant pain in the ass but absolutely necessary to keep the GPT models from going silent.

### When APIs Fail, Try, Try Again

Next, we added a proper asynchronous retry system. Here’s the simple truth: when you're juggling a dozen AI models from different vendors, some of them are going to fail. It's inevitable. Instead of just letting the app shit the bed, our new `aretry` function will now automatically retry a failed request a few times. This simple change makes the whole system more resilient, so a temporary network fart doesn't kill your entire chat.

### Also, Fixed a Dumb Typo

Finally, fixed a typo where a command-line argument was set to `-x` when it should have been `-p`. Happens.
