### Ally Chat gets a cheap, fast new brain.

Not everyone needs a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and not everyone wants to pay for it. This week was about giving users more choice, adding a fast new budget model and cleaning up some of the existing AI model names.

**A 'mini' model for the rest of us.**
The big news is the integration of `gpt-4o-mini`. Itâ€™s a fast, intelligent, and seriously affordable option for everyday tasks.

*   **Alias:** Internally, it's just `4m` for quick reference in the code (`llm.py`).
*   **Cost:** It's a budget-friendly powerhouse, a fraction of the cost of the bigger models.
*   **Availability:** It's now live in Ally Chat as another choice in the dropdown.

**Claude model cleanup.**
Anthropic keeps renaming their models, so I did some housekeeping to stay current. If you were using the old models, they've been automatically upgraded.

*   `claude-2` is now just `claude` (pointing to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`).
*   `claude-instant-v1` is now `claude-haiku` (pointing to `claude-3-haiku-20240307`).
