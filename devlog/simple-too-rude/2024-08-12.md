**Hugging Face now requires a secret handshake for some downloads.**

Spent the week fixing a download bug that was as simple as it was annoying. Turns out, for some "gated" models on Hugging Face, you can't just ask for the files anymoreâ€”you need to prove you have access. Our download script was basically knocking on the door and getting ignored.

The fix was to teach it the password. In our `huggingface-get` script, the `wget` command now includes an `Authorization` header. This header presents a secret `Bearer` token (pulled from the `$HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` environment variable), proving to Hugging Face that we're allowed to have the file. Now it works.
