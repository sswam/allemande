**Putting the AI to the Test with Python Homework**
To see if our AI code generator is any good, you have to give it problems you already know the answer to. This week, I wrote some simple new scripts—one to reverse lines in a file (`reverse_lines.py`) and another to count word frequency (`word_frequency.py`)—and then wrote unit tests to grade the AI's work. If the AI can't even get these right, it's useless for more complex tasks.

**Taming Wild Markdown**
Markdown is great, but pulling code out of it is a pain, and its tables often look like crap. I wrote a couple of new tools to fix this. One script, `markdown_code.py`, yanks all the code blocks out of a file. The other, `markdown_table_spacing.py`, automatically cleans up your tables so the columns actually align. No more manual spacing.

**Grabbing Art from Civitai on Autopilot**
Wrote a new script, `civitai_images.py`, to bulk-download image URLs from the Civitai art API. It's not just a dumb downloader; you can filter by model, username, and toggle NSFW content. It handles pagination, so you can pull thousands of images without the script choking.

**Teaching an LLM to Write a Decent Commit Message**
Left to its own devices, an LLM will write verbose, unhelpful crap for git commit messages. I put the `llm-git-commit` script on a tighter leash, giving the AI much stricter rules: a short list of allowed commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.), and clear instructions on how to format multi-line descriptions. It’s like telling a toddler exactly where they are and are not allowed to draw with crayons.

**Bug Squashing and Other Janitorial Work**
Cleaned up some odds and ends that were annoying me.
- Fixed a dumb default in `llm.py` that was re-indenting code with tabs. Now it leaves indentation alone.
- Built a tiny wrapper script (`wgall`) to run `wg` commands in parallel, because waiting is for suckers.
- Added a proper header option to the `search.py` script so the output is actually readable as a table.
