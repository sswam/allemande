### **Taming Email Hell and Making Git Smarter with AI**

This week was all about cleaning up digital messes. I built a new suite of tools to wrestle with email inboxes and taught our AI assistant to be a better code reviewer before it writes git commits. The goal is simple: automate the boring stuff so we can focus on what matters.

Oh, and it was my birthday on Saturday.

**Wrangling the Email Beast**
Email is a disaster—a mix of HTML garbage, useless headers, and other junk wrapped around the actual message. I got tired of wading through it, so I built a toolkit to automate the cleanup. The new scripts hook directly into an email server (via IMAP), fetch unread messages, rip out all the non-text crap like links and weird formatting, and then feed the clean text to an LLM for a neat summary. It’s a great way to get the gist of a mountain of emails without going insane.

**Making Git Commits Less Stupid**
Having an AI write your commit messages is cool, but what if the code it's describing has a glaring bug? Our `llm-git-commit` script is now smarter. Before it even tries to write a summary, it first prompts the AI to act as a code reviewer. The AI scans the code changes specifically looking for bugs. Only after that check does it generate a clean, descriptive message that follows the Conventional Commits spec. It’s like having a tiny, diligent QA engineer that helps you ship better code.

**Under-the-Hood Upgrades and Tidy-Ups**
Did a bit of housekeeping to keep the engine running smoothly.
*   **Claude 3 API:** Upgraded our integration to use the latest and more capable Claude 3 models.
*   **Smarter Config:** Stopped hard-coding LLM model names in a dozen different scripts. Now, we define them in a central environment variable. This makes it dead simple to swap out the AI's "brain" without having to hunt down and edit a bunch of files.
*   **UI Cleanup:** Replaced some old, deprecated components in our web UI to keep things modern and prevent future breakage.
