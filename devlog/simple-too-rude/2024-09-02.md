### **Wrestling with IMAP so my scripts don't shit the bed.**

This week was about making my tools less fragile. The email scripts got a dose of common sense, starting with the `email_fetch_and_summarise.sh` wrapper. It used to throw an error if the output folder didn't exist. Now it just creates the damn folder. Simple. I also added a confirmation step and a token count before sending text to an LLM for summarization, which acts as a good sanity check to avoid pointless API calls.

The core Python script, `imap_fetch.py`, got smarter. To list folders, it now tries the non-standard `XLIST` command (thanks, Google) for better results, falling back to the standard `LIST` if the server isn't special. I also improved the folder listing to be more readable and added an `--all` flag to show empty folders, because sometimes you need to know what's *not* there.

### **Putting a safety on the AI-powered commit gun.**

My `llm-git-commit` script can ask an LLM to review code for bugs. This is powerful, but you don't want to trigger it by accident. I added a simple "Are you sure?" confirmation before running the review.

I also tweaked the prompt I send to the AI. Instead of just asking for "bugs," I now ask it to list "important issues or suggestions," which gives much more useful feedback. Finally, I fixed an annoying shell bug where hitting `^C` at the wrong time could leave things in a broken state.

### **How to count past 24 hours without breaking your brain.**

My time-tracking scripts (`add_durations.py`, `subtract_time.py`) were using Python's `datetime` module to handle durations. This is the wrong tool for the job. `datetime` is for points in time (like 3:00 PM on Tuesday), not for lengths of time (like 36 hours). It gets weird and buggy when you go past the 24-hour mark.

I ripped that out and replaced it with simple integer arithmetic. Now the scripts just count total minutes. It's dumber, simpler, and it actually works for tracking tasks that take more than a day.

### **No more mystery meat error messages.**

There's nothing worse than an error log that just says "Something went wrong." It's useless. I updated my scripts so that when they log an error, they now include the *type* of error (`FileNotFoundError`, `ConnectionRefusedError`, etc.). This makes debugging about 10x faster because you immediately know *what* kind of problem you're looking for, not just *that* there was one.
