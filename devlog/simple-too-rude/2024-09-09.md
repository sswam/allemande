### **This week, I taught my computer to do more of my dirty work.**
The main focus was building tools to automate the boring stuff. I'm a big believer in making the machine do the grunt work, whether it's refactoring code, writing docs, or even watching movies with me. If a task is repetitive, it should be a script.

### **Making the AI a better coding partner.**
Giving an LLM access to your code is one thing; making it a useful partner is another. I added a suite of tools to make AI-assisted coding less of a gimmick.
- You can now instantly **generate boilerplate programs** from a simple template.
- A new refactoring script lets you feed the AI a messy file and a prompt, and it will **help you rewrite it**.
- It can even **mimic the style of a clean, reference file** to enforce a consistent coding style across the project.
- And, of course, I'm making it **write basic documentation**, because who has time for that?

### **Teaching the AI to watch movies with me.**
The goal was simple: watch a movie and have an AI companion in Ally Chat that knows what's happening on screen. This meant building a pipeline to get subtitles from a video into the chat in real-time.
- I wrote a tool to **grab subtitles directly from the video player** (`mpv`).
- Another script **cleans up the subtitles**, which is crucial for poorly formatted or scanned scripts.
- A final script ties it all together, synchronizing the script with the video, creating a simple way to have a "watch party" with an AI that can comment on the film.

### **Fine-tuning the LLM's brain.**
A few small but important tweaks to the core LLM integration.
- Added **model aliases** to the config. Now I can just type `gpt4` instead of some long, formal model identifier. It's a small thing, but it saves time.
- Beefed up the `llm-git-commit` tool. It now gets **clearer instructions to write high-level, useful commit messages** instead of just listing file changes. It can also see more (or less) of the code changes (`diff context`) to get the summary right.
- Started work on more flexible stopping criteria (e.g., stop generating text when you see a specific word), but **it's not working yet.** Of course.

### **Janitorial Duty: Tidying Up the Codebase.**
Did some long-overdue digital housekeeping. It's not glamorous, but a messy project is a dead project.
- Moved all the AI code-related tools into a `code` directory where they belong.
- Dumped miscellaneous utilities into a `snip` folder to get them out of the way.
- Added a couple of simple scripts for **indenting and splitting markup files**, because dealing with tangled HTML/XML tags by hand is a special kind of hell. A clean house is a clean mind.
