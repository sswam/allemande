### Devlog: Taming Scripts and Teaching the AI New Tricks

A busy week spent wrestling with a mountain of shell scripts, adding more AI helpers to the toolbox, and generally trying to impose some order on the chaos. It was a lot.

**Bringing Sanity to Bash Scripting**
Shell scripts are powerful, but they can be a fragile house of cards. A lot of time this week went into making them more robust and, for god's sake, testable. Untested code is a ticking time bomb, even if it's "just a script."
*   **Fixed the command-line option parser** (`opts`) so it stops choking on certain functions. A basic utility like this should just work.
*   **Beefed up a simple `hello.sh` script** to be a gold standard for new tools, complete with AI-powered greetings and a full test suite (using BATS). If you can't test "hello world," you're in trouble.

**Making the AI Do the Dirty Work**
The goal is to weave AI into the development workflow so it handles the boring stuff. If a machine can do it, I shouldn't have to. This week, that meant building more specialized tools.
*   **A new script (`comment.sh`) that uses an LLM to automatically document code.** This includes adding function comments and generating header blocks with usage instructions. A huge time-saver.
*   **A script (`improve.sh`) that rewrites code to a standard style,** using the AI as a formatting enforcer.
*   **Made the `todos.sh` script smarter** so it can now process `TODO`/`FIXME` comments from code without accidentally deleting them.

**New Tools for Code Janitors**
A growing codebase means more digital cruft. These scripts are for housekeeping, finding things, and generally keeping the project from turning into a landfill.
*   **A helper (`ignore.sh`) to quickly add files to `.gitignore`** without having to manually find the project root and edit the file.
*   **An auto-indenter (`indenter.py`)** that's smart enough to detect the file type and apply the correct spacing. Because life is too short to argue about tabs vs. spaces.
*   **A powerful script (`pdfocr.sh`)** to rip the text out of PDF files using optical character recognition (OCR). Plain text is king.
*   **A better note-taking script (`note.sh`)** for dropping ideas into Markdown files without breaking my workflow.

**Organizing the Toolbox**
Finally, some boring but essential cleanup. Having a pile of sharp tools is useless if you can't find the one you need.
*   **Improved the `rubbish` scripts** for safely moving or copying files to a temporary "trash" folder before deleting them.
*   **Updated the main environment (`env.sh`)** so the system can actually find all these new tools.
*   **Added more design docs** and even a business plan to figure out where this project is actually going. You can't just code forever without a map.
