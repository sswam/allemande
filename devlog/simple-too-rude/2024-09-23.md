## This Week: More AI Toys, A Big Cleanup, and Better Tools for Everything

This week was a mix of paying down technical debt and building cool new stuff. The main push was to clean up the codebase by properly integrating the `ally` library everywhere, while also adding more LLM-powered tools and beefing up our image generation pipeline. As usual, I'm just calling it like I see it in the commits.

### The Great Cleanup (`ally` Library & Core Scripts)

A ton of work went into making the `ally` library the backbone for how the project handles basic tasks. This kind of refactoring is a pain, but it makes everything more consistent and easier to maintain.

*   **Smarter Loading:** Implemented "lazy loading" in the `ally` library. This means modules aren't loaded until you actually need them, which cuts down on startup time and memory hogging. No more loading a bunch of crap you're not going to use.
*   **Better I/O:** Ripped out a lot of the old input/output code and replaced it with the `ally` library's `istream` and `ostream` handlers for more flexible and consistent I/O.
*   **Scripting Tweaks:** Cleaned up a bunch of Bash scripts. The `opts` script now has cleaner usage output, and I added a couple of "one-liner" LLM scripts (`1sp` for a single sentence, `1wp` for a single word) for quick jobs. Also dropped the BASH strictness enforcement, because sometimes you just need to get things done.

### Making the AI Smarter (LLM & Image Generation)

The real fun is always in giving the AI more to do. This week saw new tools for both text and image generation.

*   **New LLM Tricks:**
	*   Whipped up a `combine.sh` script that uses an LLM to merge similar text inputs into a more coherent result.
	*   Added a `translate.sh` script to convert files from one format to another (e.g., JSON to YAML) using an LLM.
	*   Tossed in support for Perplexity and Google AI models, and made module loading for them dynamic so they only get pulled in when called.
*   **Making Pretty Pictures:**
	*   Got a proper async client working for the Stable Diffusion WebUI API. Now we can generate images with fine-tuned control (prompts, seed, steps, CFG, etc.) right from a script.
	*   Added `image_debug.sh` to analyze image parameters and an `image_stamp.py` tool to read, write, and erase metadata without wrecking the image. It's now much easier to see how an image was made and to manage its tags.
	*   Hooked up SDXL support and added a text-to-image demo script to show it off.

### New Tools and General Housekeeping

A few other useful utilities and changes got built out this week.

*   **Web Summarizer:** A new script (`web_summary`) to fetch a webpage and spit out a summary. Simple, but effective.
*   **Code Language Detector:** A small tool (`code-language.py`) to guess what language a file is written in based on its extension.
*   **File Swapper:** A utility to swap the contents of two files, now with support for hard links.
*   **Better Testing:** Added a pile of new BATS tests. The AI-powered tests are now available but kept behind a flag so they don't run by default and cost a fortune.
*   **Code Reorg:** Moved a bunch of scripts around to more logical homes. For example, LLM scripts like `improve.sh` were moved out of `code/` and into a dedicated `llm/` directory since they're useful for more than just code.

### What's Next

The project's moving fast. The focus is on making the CLI tools less clunky and standardizing how the LLM tasks work. I'm also keen to see how far we can push this lazy loading stuff to make everything feel faster and more responsive. The goal is to build powerful, no-bullshit tools that just work.
