### Coding Janitor Duty: Imposing order on chaos.
A project's file structure can either be a clean workshop or a hoarder's garage. This week was about cleaning the garage. We created a central "canon" directory to act as the single source of truth for our most important scripts. All the duplicate, slightly-different aliases now point to this one sacred spot. It's just common sense. We also went on a renaming spree, enforcing snake_case for script names and adding proper file extensions so even a blind shell script knows what it's looking at. Simple, clean, and how it should have been from the start.

### The AI is now the intern, the translator, and the project manager.
We're pushing our AI integration way beyond just clever chat responses. A ton of the core AI functions were updated to be `async`, which is a fancy way of saying they're now much more responsive and don't lock everything up while they're thinking. More importantly, we've given the AI new jobs:
- A `translate.sh` script to convert files from one format to another.
- An AI-powered personal project manager to help guide development.
- An interactive "interviewer" script for conversational tasks.
The goal is to automate the boring stuff so we can focus on the hard problems.

### Making the front-end faster and less fragile.
The web UI got some much-needed attention. We added Progressive Web App (PWA) support, which means you can "install" it on your phone or desktop for a more native feel. To fight slow-loading pages, we implemented lazy loading for imagesâ€”they only load when you actually scroll to them. Why waste bandwidth? Behind the scenes, we've finally added a proper BATS testing framework. We even have tests for the AI, but they're flagged separately because running LLM queries for every single test would be ridiculously expensive.

### Not everything works on the first try.
Let's be real, a lot of time was spent wrestling with Stable Diffusion. Getting the image viewer and the SDXL text-to-image pipeline to work correctly has been a pain. It's a powerful tool, but debugging its setup is a nightmare. This fight isn't over. Looking ahead, the focus is on refining all these new AI command-line tools into a single, streamlined workflow, probably built around `ally.sh`.
