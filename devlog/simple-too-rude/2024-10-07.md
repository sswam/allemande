### This Week: Herding Cats and Teaching AIs New Tricks

Huge week. We’re finally taming the wild west of our command-line scripts and cramming a ton of new AI-powered helpers into the system. The goal is simple: make everything work together seamlessly and give users (and us) some ridiculously powerful tools.

**The Great Unification**
All our scripts used to be a mess of one-offs, each with its own way of doing things. Now, we're forcing them all to use our `ally.sh` framework. This means consistent commands, less duplicated code, and frankly, less insanity for us to manage. It's a huge cleanup job, but it's the right way to build a system that doesn't suck.

**The AI Toolbox Gets Fatter**
We went on a spree adding AI tools for just about everything:
*   **Code & Commits:** Need to clean up ugly code or write a Git commit message? We have AI scripts for that now (`improve.sh`, `messy.sh`). Stop writing garbage commit messages.
*   **Text & Tone:** We also added some fun stuff, like AI that can praise (`praise.sh`) or roast (`roast.sh`) text, and more practical tools for simplifying or translating language.
*   **Docs & Data:** New tools to automatically generate API documentation and convert between data formats, because who has time for that busywork?
*   **Formatting:** A new style module now automatically formats Python and Bash code, so everything looks consistent without us having to think about it.

**Smarter File Handling**
Managing files is a pain, so we built better tools for it. We added new utilities to find files and executables instantly (`wich`, `find`), an interactive tool to sort files into folders (`curate.sh`), and better ways to manage temporary 'rubbish' files. Small quality-of-life things that save a lot of headaches.

**Web App Polish**
The Ally Chat web interface got some love. It’s now faster (we made images load smartly), and you can add it to your phone's home screen like a native app (that's what a Progressive Web App, or PWA, does). We’re also tinkering with voice chat, but that's still on the drawing board.

**What's Next?**
The main challenge is still dragging our older code into this new, unified system. It’s like renovating an old house while you're still living in it—messy, but worth it.

Next up, we’re focusing on making our core frameworks more robust with proper tests and continuing to build out the new "Portals" feature, which I'm pretty excited about. And, of course, more AI refinements. Always more AI.
