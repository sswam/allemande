### **Whipping the Codebase into Shape with More AI and Less Crap**

This week's theme was fighting entropy. A growing project accumulates cruft like a magnet in a scrapyard—different ways to parse options, handle I/O, log messages. It's a pain in the ass to maintain. The solution is to force everything through a single, unified framework (`ally`) so it's consistent and easier to manage.

### **One Framework to Rule Them All**

The big push was getting everything to use the `ally` framework. This meant ripping out other libraries like `argh` and centralizing all input/output through a module called `geput`. The goal is simple: any script, anywhere, should handle command-line arguments and I/O the exact same way.

To speed up this crusade, I started building an AI-powered refactoring tool (`ally-refactor.py`) to automate converting the mountains of old code. Giving a mentally challenged muggle access to powerful AI coding tools is like giving a toddler a jackhammer, but this time I'm pointing it at my own stuff.

### **Putting the AI to Work on Useful (and Weird) Things**

The army of AI tools continues to grow.

*   **Code Refactoring:** An AI that helps rewrite old, messy Python code to the new standard. It's still a work-in-progress, but the goal is to have the machine clean up its own house.
*   **Local Text Completion:** A new `complete.py` script for text generation with local LLMs. It streams output so you're not waiting forever, and it doesn't phone home to Big Tech.
*   **Better Summaries:** The `summary` tool got an upgrade. Now it's forced to be as concise as possible—a single line, no more rambling.
*   **Chinese Whispers:** For fun, I built an LLM-based translation game (`whispers.py`). It's exactly as reliable as you'd expect.

### **General Housekeeping and Other Utilities**

While wrestling with the main framework, I also cleaned up a bunch of smaller things.

The script for finding and deleting junk files is now more aggressive, and I added a new tool (`git_today.sh`) to quickly see what I actually accomplished in a day. Also built a slick new coroutine-based tool to merge files, because doing it the slow way is for chumps.

### **The Road Ahead is Paved with Technical Debt**

The biggest challenge is the sheer volume of legacy code that needs to be modernized. It's rewarding, but it's a slog. The main hold-up is just the size of the effort.

Next week, the focus is on finishing that AI refactor tool and making the core I/O system properly testable. More AI integration is planned, but a lot of it has to wait until the foundation isn't built on sand. The work never ends.
