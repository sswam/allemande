### Taming Legacy Code and Giving the AI New Toys

There's nothing quite like digging through old C and shell scripts you wrote years ago. It’s a mess. This week was all about forcing some discipline on that chaos, mostly by beating everything into submission with my `ally` option parsing library. If you’re going to have standards, you may as well enforce them.

And, of course, I couldn't resist adding more weird AI features. Because what’s the point of having a chat app if you can't make it do things no other app can?

Here’s the rundown:

*   **Making old code less dumb.** A pile of old C and shell scripts now use the `ally` library for command-line arguments. Consistency is king, even if you have to force it retroactively. This makes the tools less of a pain to use and modify.
*   **AI plays artist.** Hooked up new tools for generating images and even video directly from text prompts. The idea is to let users do this stuff directly from chat, because why not?
*   **How old do you look?** Started messing with AI age estimation models. Partly for safety applications, partly because it's a weirdly fascinating (and creepy) problem to solve. I added a script that watches a folder and runs the analysis on any new images that appear.
*   **The machine critiques itself.** Expanded the AI tooling to include an AI-generated code review. It's surprisingly good at spotting dumb mistakes and sometimes even has decent ideas.
*   **Fixing flaky speech tools.** Speaker diarization was unreliable as hell, so I finally built a proper test harness for the core C code. Added timeouts so a broken test doesn't hang the whole system. Testing blind is just asking for pain.

The main headache? Retrofitting old code is a grind. And a lot of the new AI tools are basically "works on my machine"—some were even scaffolded by the AI itself and are barely tested by a human. That’s a problem for another day.
