### **This week, Ally Chat learned to see, download, and script better.**

A busy week bolting new features onto Ally Chat. The focus was on giving the AI more senses and skillsâ€”from classifying images to pulling down new models from the web on its own. Also spent a lot of time on the unglamorous but necessary work of improving tooling and setup scripts.

**Teaching the AI to See.**
Hooked up FastAI to do image classification. It's not just using a pre-baked model; I added tools to fine-tune it on specific datasets, which is crucial for getting it to recognize what you *actually* care about, not just "cat" or "dog." This makes the vision capabilities a lot more practical.

**Making Model Hoarding Easier.**
CivitAI is a massive library of AI models, but getting them into a project can be a pain. I wrote a downloader tool that pulls models directly using the API. Just feed it a model ID or URL, and it handles the rest. Less manual downloading, more time for actual work.

**Smarter Web Scraping.**
The Selenium integration got a lot less dumb. It can now save and load cookies, so it doesn't get logged out of sites constantly while scraping. I also added better ways to control the browser, like running it visibly (non-headless) for debugging when it inevitably breaks, and letting it scroll to specific parts of a page instead of just guessing.

**Designing a Language That Doesn't Suck.**
Started drafting the design for AMPS, my new scripting language. The core idea is to build something with a relation-based approach and bidirectional evaluation. Think less "do this, then do that" and more "these things are related in this way, now figure it out." It's a long road, but the goal is a language that's more intuitive for complex, multi-agent systems.

**Polishing the Toolshed and Sweeping the Floor.**
A ton of time went into general polish.
*   Wrote a bunch of new bash helpers (`quiet-` scripts to shut up noisy commands, `needargs.sh` to make scripts fail gracefully).
*   Improved the Debian setup script to be less of a pain (it now asks what editor you want, a shockingly novel idea).
*   Added linter and formatter scripts (`linty.sh`, `formy.sh`) because consistent code is readable code.
*   Little things that just make development less miserable.

### **Where it Hurts.**

*   **Legacy Code:** The effort to convert old code to the new `ally` structure is a special kind of hell. It's complex, and every step reveals another dependency you forgot about.
*   **AI Robustness:** Making AI tools robust enough that they don't just fall over when you look at them funny is proving to be a massive time sink. They work great 90% of the time, and that last 10% is where all the work is.
