### This week, I gave my AI a pair of eyes. The plumbing got fixed too.

Another week of juggling shiny new features with the soul-crushing grind of fixing old, broken shit. The big win is that Ally Chat can now analyze images with YOLO, but a lot of time was spent on janitorial work that's less glamorous but just as important. If you don't clean up your own mess, your shiny new features will be built on a pile of garbage.

**The AI can finally see what it's looking at**
I bolted on YOLO object detection, which is a fancy way of saying the AI can look at a picture, identify what's in it, and draw boxes around the objects. You can get the coordinates for the boxes, the center points, or just see the detected objects in a pop-up window. It's the first step to giving the AI a proper set of eyes instead of just having it guess based on text descriptions.

**Making the tools less dumb**
A lot of this week was just cleaning up messes and improving existing tools so they stop breaking in stupid ways.
*   **Civitai Downloads:** The tools for pulling AI models and images from Civitai were clunky. I rebuilt the image fetching to use cursor-based pagination so it doesn't choke, and now when you download a model, it actually tells you useful info like the base model and training words.
*   **Environment Sanity:** Fixed the scripts that detect and activate virtual environments. Now they're smart enough to not activate a new environment if one is already running, preventing the kind of conflict that makes you want to throw your computer out the window.
*   **General Housekeeping:** Converted a pile of old scripts to use my `python3-allemande` setup so they all play nice in the same sandbox. I also fixed some dumb error messages in my `formy`, `linty`, and `testy` tools that were crying about binary files or files that didn't exist. Basic stuff that should have been right the first time.

**AMPS Demos, with a little help from my AI friend**
While talking with Gemini Flash, I cranked out some demo files for the AMPS module. Now there are clear examples of how to use it in C, Python, and Shell. It's one thing to build a tool, it's another to make it usable for someone who isn't me.
