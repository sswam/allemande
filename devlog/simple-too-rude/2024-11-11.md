### Finally ditching Basic Auth for something that doesn't suck.

This week, the main job was tearing out our old, clunky basic authentication and replacing it with a proper JWT (JSON Web Token) system for Ally Chat. Basic auth is a pain in the ass and less secure, since it sends your username and password with every request. JWTs are much better; you log in once and get a secure, temporary token that proves who you are. It’s like getting a keycard for the day instead of yelling your password at every door.

This was a major overhaul that touched the web server, the backend services, and the chat client itself. We also cleaned up a bunch of utility scripts to make them a bit smarter.

#### The New Login System (Now with more JWT)

The goal was to have a single, secure login that works across all of Ally Chat's subdomains (`chat`, `rooms`, `alfred`, etc.).

*   **A New Front Desk:** We built a new authentication service that handles logins. It checks your username and password (hashed with bcrypt, of course) and, if you're legit, hands out a secure JWT token.
*   **Smarter Cookies:** The token is stored in a cookie that’s locked down properly (`httponly`, `secure`, `samesite`) to prevent common browser attacks.
*   **One Logout to Rule Them All:** When you log out, you are now logged out everywhere. No more weird lingering sessions on other subdomains.
*   **Username Login:** We switched from email-based to username-based logins. It’s faster for you and better for privacy.

#### Teaching the Bouncer New Tricks (Nginx & HAProxy Config)

Our web servers, Nginx and HAProxy, are the bouncers at the door. They needed to be taught how to check for the new JWT keycards instead of the old basic auth passwords.

*   **Checking Tokens, Not Passwords:** Nginx now uses a special module to validate JWTs on incoming requests. We’re now correctly identifying users based on the secure token's `sub` (subject) field, not the old, insecure `remote_user` variable.
*   **No More Annoying Redirects:** For API calls or embedded content, getting a login page instead of an error is just broken. We fixed it so those endpoints correctly return a `401 Unauthorized` error if your token is missing or invalid. That’s how it should be.
*   **Longer Timeouts:** We bumped up the connection timeouts on HAProxy to 10 minutes. This should prevent annoying disconnects if you’re running a process that takes a while to complete.

#### General Housekeeping & New Tools

You can't just build new features; you also have to clean up the garage.

*   **Smarter Scripts:** Some of our shell scripts are now better at automatically finding the project’s home directory, so you don’t have to set it manually. We also improved our script for running commands as 'root' so it doesn't lose track of important system paths.
*   **New Utilities:** Added a couple of new scripts for developers: one for converting data between binary and hex, and another for processing old-school RFC 2822 email-style headers.
*   **Better File Locking:** Implemented proper file locking to prevent scripts from stepping on each other's toes when writing to the same file.

#### Challenges

It wasn't all smooth sailing.
*   **Security is Hard:** Getting JWTs right is tricky. One wrong configuration and you’ve created a security hole. This required a lot of careful testing.
*   **Async Bugs:** We uncovered some nasty bugs in our asynchronous server code. That's now on the top of the list to get squashed.
