### **Teaching the AI to Shut Up and Play Nice**

This week's main event was wrestling with the Large Language Models in Ally Chat. The goal is to make them more useful and less like a chaotic free-for-all. A big win was getting local models to work better, because not everyone wants to rely on big tech clouds for their AI. Plus, when you have multiple AIs in a room, you need to stop them from talking over each other.

*   **Local Models on Your Machine:** Hooked up `llama-cpp-python` to support GGUF models. This means you can run a wider range of language models on your own computer without selling your data to a cloud provider. More power to the user.
*   **Smarter Generation:** Ditched the old token-based stopping method for a slicker streaming/regex approach. This stops the AI from rambling on and makes its responses cleaner and more reliable.
*   **Better Manners:** Tweaked the chat agents so only one AI model replies at a time in a group chat. It was getting annoying.
*   **Janitorial Work:** Cleaned up the chat interface so markdown and math formulas don't look like a dog's breakfast. Also did some boring but necessary backend cleanup, like renaming the `ALLEMANDE_PORTS` environment variable to `ALLEMANDE_PORTALS`.

### **Sharpening the Digital Swiss Army Knife**

A developer's life is filled with endless, repetitive tasks. The only sane response is to automate them into oblivion with good command-line scripts. This week, we added a bunch of new tools to the toolbox.

*   **Beating Data into Submission:** Added a suite of scripts (`txt2tsv`, `tsv-tidy`, `kutc`) to handle messy text and data files. Plain text is king, but sometimes it needs a little persuasion.
*   **Smarter File Handling:** Instead of leaving backup files in `/tmp`, they now go to the system trash (rubbish bin), where they belong. Also added proper file locking (`fcntl.flock()`) so scripts don't step on each other's toes.
*   **Shell Guidance:** Added a safety rule to our shell guide: for god's sake, use `mktemp` for temporary files. It's not that hard.
*   **General Fixes:** Fixed a dumb parameter swap in our translation script and added `uniqo.pl` for when you just need to remove duplicate lines from a file, no questions asked.

### **Dipping a Toe into Game Development (Because Why Not?)**

Taking a little break from the AI madness to explore game development with Pygame. It's a fun way to experiment with different programming concepts.

*   **A Simple Game Engine:** Wrote some boilerplate code (`boiler.py`) to handle the boring parts of making a gameâ€”event loops, drawing objects, playing sounds, etc.
*   **Behold, "Move the Square!":** Created a masterpiece of a game (`game1.py`) using the new engine. You can move a square with the keyboard and drag it with the mouse. It even has music. Look out, AAA studios.

### **The Abject Failure of Trying to Build a PWA**

Sometimes you have to admit defeat. We made a run at turning Ally Chat into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline support and push notifications. It did not go well.

*   **The Attempt:** Added a service worker (`service-worker.js`) and a manifest file, which are the key ingredients for a PWA.
*   **The Result:** It's a broken mess. The service worker is buggy as hell and a nightmare to test. Ripped it all out for now. We'll fight this battle another day.
