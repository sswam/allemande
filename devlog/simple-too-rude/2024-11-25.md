### **This Week in Code: Making the Chat App Smarter and the Tools Do More Work for Me**

Another productive week of wrangling code. The main focus was on improving Ally Chat, but I also built some new tools to make my own life easier and messed around with some simple game dev.

**Teaching the AI to Behave in Ally Chat**
The chat app is getting more polished. I'm trying to make the AIs feel less like generic bots and more like actual participants.
*   **Wrangling Claude:** Gave Claude some special instructions to make sure it replies as itself, not as some weirdly prefixed assistant. Fine-tuned how the app handles AI responses to be more reliable.
*   **Less Janky Keyboarding:** Fixed some annoying keyboard behavior between chat windows for a smoother experience.
*   **PWA nonsense:** Started the process of turning the web app into a "real" app (a Progressive Web App) that could eventually do push notifications. It's a pain in the ass and still broken. More debugging ahead.

**Fixing the Robot Voice**
The text-to-speech model (Parler-TTS) kept breaking because of version updates. I've now locked it to a specific version that actually works. I also made it default to a smaller "mini" modelâ€”it's not quite as good as the big one, but it's much faster to get up and running, which is less annoying for development.

**Building Better Toys and Automating My Workflow**
I hate repetitive tasks, so I built some scripts to eliminate them.
*   **File Watcher:** Wrote a new script, `awatch`, that watches for file changes and automatically runs a command. No more manually rebuilding code every five seconds like a chump.
*   **Smarter Notes:** The `plan` tool now automatically picks the right note file for whatever I'm working on. One less thing to think about.
*   **Game Stuff:** Messed around with some simple visual toys. You can now infinitely zoom into a fractal (a Sierpinski gasket) and scribble on the screen. Pointless, but fun.

**Making API Docs Readable for LLMs**
LLMs are powerful, but they choke on garbage input. I built a new tool that takes bloated OpenAPI documentation and boils it down into clean, simple markdown. This makes it much easier to feed API specs to an AI for analysis or code generation.
