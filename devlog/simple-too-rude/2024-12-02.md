### Your Chat App is a Glorified Notepad. Mine Now Handles Your Files.

This week was all about making Ally Chat less of a toy and more of a tool. Most chat apps choke on anything more complex than a goddamn emoji. Now, you can dump files right into a chat, and the system is smart enough to figure out what to do with it.

*   **File Uploads That Just Work:** Drag in an image, video, or audio clip. It gets uploaded, renamed to avoid conflicts, and inserted into the chat with the right Markdown so it just *appears*. Images, audio, videoâ€”it all plays directly. No more downloading mystery files to see what they are.
*   **Fixing Shitty Video Formats:** We've all been there. Someone sends a video in some obscure `.MOV` format that only plays on their mom's iMac. Now, the server checks video compatibility and automatically re-encodes it to a web-friendly format if needed. Because I'd rather have the server do the work than make the user run `ffmpeg` by hand.

### Tuning the AI Brains

I also spent time tweaking the AI integrations. Giving users access to powerful models is one thing; making them actually usable is another.

*   **Teaching AIs When to Shut Up:** The local agents are now smarter about knowing when to stop talking, so they don't ramble on or step on each other's toes in a group chat. It uses better "stop sequences," which are now configurable in the request if you want to get your hands dirty.
*   **More Creative, More Chaotic Llama:** Tweaked the Llama models to be more creative (read: chaotic) by killing top-k sampling and adjusting the penalties. Sometimes you want a coherent answer, and sometimes you want unhinged genius. Now you have more control over that.
*   **Deeper A1111 Control:** Added more knobs to turn for the A1111 image generator, like picking specific model checkpoints. More power for the artists.

### Under the Hood Janitorial Work

A lot of time was spent on the boring but essential shit that keeps the system from falling apart.

*   **Ripping out Dependencies:** I replaced the external `slugify` package with a custom one. Why depend on someone else's code for something so simple? Fewer dependencies, less bloat.
*   **Admin Script Overhaul:** Beefed up the admin scripts for managing multiple users and server instances. It's still command-line, because GUIs are for children, but now it has better help messages and handles multi-client setups cleanly.
*   **Wrestling with Async Code:** Refactoring the streaming code was a fucking nightmare, but it's done. Using context managers and queues makes it more robust and less likely to leak resources or just silently die.

The goal is to build something that's not just a chat app, but a proper creative and collaborative environment. One that doesn't treat its users like idiots. This week was a solid step in that direction.
