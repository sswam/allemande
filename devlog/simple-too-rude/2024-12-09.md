### This week in Ally Chat: A new game, less jank, and smarter AI.

Added a bunch of features and fixes this week. The headline addition is "Rockfall," a puzzle game, because a chat app should be more than just chat. Also spent time cleaning up the UI and tuning the AI to be less stupid.

#### New Game: Rockfall!
I added "Rockfall," a new puzzle platformer inspired by the classic Boulder Dash. You run around, collect diamonds, and try not to get crushed by falling rocks. It's a fun distraction and a good test of the platform's ability to handle more than just text and images. An app should be a platform for interactive experiences, not just a walled garden for conversation.

#### Better Chat Control: Undo and Archive
Ever send a message you immediately regret? You can now undo your last message to wipe it from existence. For admins who need to save a chat history before nuking a room, there's now an archive button. More control for users is always a good thing.

#### Cleaning Up the Frontend Mess
The web UI got a few much-needed improvements.
*   **Button layout:** The input controls were a bit of a disaster. They're now sorted into logical groups (main, add, edit), so it's easier to find what you're looking for.
*   **YouTube embeds:** Videos no longer look squashed and stretched. Thumbnails now keep their proper aspect ratio.
*   **Fixes:** The video recording controls actually work now. The little `flash()` animation when a message arrives now targets the right thing. Simple stuff that should have worked in the first place.

#### Tuning the AI Brain
Spent some time tweaking the generation parameters for the Llama LLM to make it less repetitive and more creative. This meant ditching `penalty_alpha` (it was useless) and dialing in the `temperature` and `top-p` sampling based on some good advice. The result is noticeably better responses.

#### Housekeeping and Backend Tweaks
A bunch of under-the-hood work went into making things run smoother.
*   The command-line tools for prompting the AI can now pull in multiple files for context, which is a huge help for complex queries.
*   The "hello world" JavaScript example is now simpler and works correctly in both Node.js and Deno without extra boilerplate.
*   Fixed a dumb bug where extra spaces around usernames in chat messages would break things.
*   Disabled the demo cronjobs in the admin scripts. No more pointless noise.
