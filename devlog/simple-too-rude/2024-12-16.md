### Now the AI Annoys You On a Schedule

Got back from a holiday break and decided the first order of business was to make my chat AI less passive. It’s a bit weird that these powerful models just sit there silently waiting for you to say something. So, I fixed it. Now, the AI can be set up to start conversations on its own.

### Key Changes This Week

**The AI Now Starts the Conversation**
I wrote a new script (`initiative.py`) that uses a simple cronjob to prompt an AI to talk to a user at scheduled times. It's not just a dumb timer; it checks if you've been chatting recently to avoid being annoying and has randomized delays so it doesn't feel robotic. Naturally, there's a `--no-act` flag for testing so it doesn't just start spamming people during development.

**Get Poked When Things Happen**
If the AI is going to start talking on its own, you probably want to know about it without having the tab open 24/7. So I finally added web push notifications. It’s the standard setup: click a button, grant permission, and the server can now send you alerts through the browser. This involved adding a `/x/subscribe` endpoint and wiring it all together with the required VAPID key nonsense. Now the app can actually get your attention.

**Added a New Anime Art Model**
Expanded the AI's artistic range by adding the "Poni" model for generating anime-style images, including the NSFW variety, because of course.

**Making Log-Following Less Fragile**
My log-following tool, `atail`, got some much-needed love. Turns out `inotify` isn't as reliable as you'd think, especially when log files get rotated or nuked. So I added a polling mode as a fallback and a `restart` option to keep watching a file even if it gets deleted and recreated. Makes server-side monitoring way less of a headache.

### Housekeeping and Other Code Masonry

*   **Thread-Safe Dictionary:** Wrote a proper thread-safe dictionary using a mutex lock. It's amazing how often you need one of these and just assume Python's GIL will save you. It won't.
*   **New CLI Tools:** Created a new Perl-based CLI tool (`ted.pl`) for quick text manipulation, because sometimes `sed` and `awk` are just annoying.
*   **No More Caveman Tactics:** Stopped copying "hello world" files around and started using proper templates for creating new C, C++, and Python files.
*   **Configuration Fix:** Switched from symlinking `config.sh` to copying it. Symlinks seem like a good idea until they break something in a weird way you can't debug for an hour.
*   **The Usual Cleanup:** Plus the usual assortment of minor fixes: better path cleaning, removing dead code and UI buttons, improving log messages, and adding a quick disk speed test script.
