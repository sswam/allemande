### This week's grind: UI tweaks and bug squashing.

A productive holiday week fixing annoying little things and adding some quality-of-life features to Ally Chat. No massive breakthroughs, just the necessary work of making the app less frustrating to use.

**The chat recording UI is slightly less dumb now.**
The old audio/video recording interface was a bit clunky.
- The "pause" button is gone. Who needs a separate button for that? Now you just tap the timer to pause or resume. Simple.
- The "cancel" buttons now say "back", which actually makes sense in context. It's the small things.

**Teaching the AIs to listen better.**
The agents were getting a bit deaf, ignoring you if you didn't say their name *just so*. I tweaked the logic so it's smarter about recognizing names at the start of a sentence or followed by a comma, like "Gemini, what's up?". It's not rocket science, just basic pattern matching that should have been there before. I also turned down some of the logging spam so it stops cluttering up the chat.

**Finally, comments in A1111 prompts.**
Staring at a giant wall of un-annotated prompt text for image generation is a nightmare. Now you can leave yourself notes or comment out parts you're testing. The app strips the comments before sending the prompt to the image generator, obviously. It makes complex prompting much more manageable.

**Squashing a stupid bug in `atail`.**
`atail` is my little utility for watching log files. It had this annoying bug where if a log file got rotated (i.e., deleted and recreated), `atail` would just give up and stop watching. Fixed it. Now it properly latches back onto the new file so my log monitoring doesn't silently die anymore.

**Other stuff:**
- **LLM Self-Control:** Jotting down some notes on letting an LLM change its own parameters on the fly, like emitting a token to adjust its own "temperature" to be more creative or factual mid-sentence. Could be powerful, could be a disaster. Fun to think about.
- **Makefile Cleanup:** Replaced a hardcoded log path with a variable, because hardcoding paths is a sin.
