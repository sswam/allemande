### **Teaching the AI to have a personality.**
I got tired of the chatbots sounding like lobotomized customer service reps. Telling an AI "don't repeat yourself" is a great way to make it get stuck in a loop repeating itself. So, I ripped out that dumb instruction.

Now, agents like Ally have simpler, more direct prompts: "You are Ally. Ally is creative and talkative." It's less hand-holding and, ironically, leads to more natural conversations. The goal is to make them sound like actual characters, not a language model with a safety manual stapled to its forehead.

### **Keeping an eye on the machine before it shits the bed.**
Nothing worse than the server grinding to a halt because it ran out of memory or disk space. I wrote a simple `monitor.sh` script to watch the vitals: disk usage, memory, system load, and whether it can still ping the outside world (8.8.8.8). If anything looks sketchy, it screams a `WARNING:`. This way I get a heads-up *before* everything catches fire. Proactive, not reactive.

### **Getting the LLM to talk good.**
The core LLM config was a bit of a mess. I spent some time tuning the generation parameters to stop it from getting repetitive. Also cleaned up the config to be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), because copy-pasting settings is for amateurs. The main `brain.sh` script now uses the stable `default.yaml` config instead of the `experiment.yaml` I was messing with. Time to stop tinkering and use what actually works.

### **A few other tweaks.**
*   **Forked `llama-cpp-python`:** Relying on the main pip package is a pain when you need to fix or change something fast. Now I'm using my own local fork for more control.
*   **Bash hygiene:** Added the `local` keyword to some variables in a script. A tiny fix, but not doing it is how you get baffling bugs from variables leaking all over the place.
