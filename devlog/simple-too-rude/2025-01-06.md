### **Giving the local AIs a personality transplant.**
This week was mostly about tweaking the LLM agents and cleaning up my own messes.

**Making the local bots less robotic.**
The system prompts defining the local AI characters (Ally, Barbie, Callam) were getting bloated. I cut the crap out of them to make their personalities more consistent and distinct. For example, Ally's prompt is simpler nowâ€”just "creative and talkative" instead of redundant nonsense. Callam still talks like a pirate, so he needs special handling. Arrr.

**Fighting repetitive, "dry" AI output.**
The Llama model was getting stuck in loops. I changed the sequence breaker to "-----" in the config, which seems to help it shut up and move on. Also tweaked the "dryness" settings (`allowed_length`, `multiplier`, etc.) to get less boring responses. It's a pain to get the balance right, so I'll probably be back here again.

**Fixing my own dumb mistakes.**
A quick but important fix. In my messy internal scripts, I had the Gemini models coded as "g" and "f". That's just asking for trouble. Corrected them to "gp" and "gf" so the chat app actually calls the right model. It's the small things that'll get you.
