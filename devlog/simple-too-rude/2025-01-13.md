**Making Ally Chat's AI Art Less Annoying and More Awesome**

Spent the week fixing a bunch of little annoyances in Ally Chat, mostly around image generation. Also built a neat little command-line tool for digital archaeology.

*   **No More Annoying Timeouts.** AI art taking too long and timing out is garbage. So I tripled the timeout to 3 minutes, which should be enough for even complex requests. Images also get an automatic high-res upscale for better detail, and I've thrown in two new models, `Coni` and `Boni`, for more creative firepower.

*   **Images You Can Actually See.** Tiny images suck. So I made them bigger, taking up more of the screen so you don't have to squint. You can also now click 'em to open in a new tab, like a normal person.

*   **Recovering Data from Dead Files.** Ever had a file get corrupted and turn into a useless brick? I wrote a simple command-line tool, `recover_non_zero`, that scans a file and pulls out any chunks of data that aren't just empty space (zeroes). It's a last-ditch effort for data recovery, and I'm sure someone will find a clever use for it.

*   **Making the AI Less Boring.** Getting tired of the AI spitting out the same bland, repetitive mush. I tweaked the `top_p` and `top_k` settings to make the language model take more creative risks. It's a bit of a black art, but the goal is less predictable, more interesting text.

*   **General Housekeeping.** Finally, I did some basic cleanup. New users get a clearer welcome message explaining how things work, and I actually documented the image size commands properly so people know what to type.
