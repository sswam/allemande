### Fixing the Annoying Little Things in Ally Chat

This week wasn't about some huge, flashy new feature. It was about sanding down the rough edges and fixing the small, dumb shit that can ruin the experience. Sometimes that's more important.

Here’s the rundown:

*   **Better AI Art (and Smut).** I bumped the image generation timeout to 5 minutes so it stops crapping out on complex prompts. And for the degenerates among us, the "Illy" model got some NSFW adetailers to render breasts and pussies with more precision. You're welcome.
*   **The AI Conductor Got a Little Smarter.** The conductor—the piece of code that figures out which AI should respond in a group chat—had a stupid blind spot. If anyone typed the word "System," it would get confused and think the system itself was a user. Fixed it by adding "System" to an ignore list.
*   **Fixing My Own Dumb Typos.** The documentation for setting image dimensions was just wrong. I'd written "set" instead of "sets." I also put all the valid examples on a single line so you can just copy-paste the whole block without thinking.
*   **A More Forgiving Shell Script.** My `see.sh` helper script now tries to use `mp` to play media, but if it's not installed, it'll fall back to `mpv`. A tiny fix so things don't break just because you use a different media player.
*   **Another Classic UTF-8 Bug.** My `tsv2txt` tool was mangling text because it was counting bytes instead of characters. A classic rookie mistake when you forget the world doesn't run on ASCII. Swapped in `utf8.RuneCountInString` to properly handle multi-byte characters. Problem solved.
