### Herding AI cats in a group chat.

Took a week off, now I'm back to wrangling the AI agents in Ally Chat. This week was all about making them less like mindless bots and more like actual participants in a conversation. The focus was on improving agent personalities, the conductor that manages them, and the images they spit out.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

*   **AIs that actually pay attention.** The 'conductor' AI that manages the chat is less dumb now. It can spot a name anywhere in a message, not just at the very beginning. More importantly, you can now address "everyone" or "anyone" and the conductor will pick a few AIs to reply. It makes the group chat feel less like you're talking into a void and more like a real, chaotic group conversation.

*   **Sharper, smaller images.** You can now have the AI generate JPEGs instead of just PNGs, which keeps file sizes down without looking like crap. Also stomped a bug where the app would choke on the image metadata from ComfyUI. Now it parses correctly.

*   **New personalities in the asylum.** Tweaked the backstories for agents like Ally and Barbie to give them more personality, and added a new GPT-4 based agent named Emmie to the roster. The goal is to make them feel more distinct instead of all sounding like the same underlying model.

*   **Less tedious setup.** Got tired of setting up every new agent from scratch. I've now created base configs for different agent types (character bots, coding assistants, remote APIs like Claude/GPT). Should make adding new agents a lot faster.

Still wrestling with where to store agent configs. Right now they're scattered, which is a mess. Need to decide whether to centralize them or keep them on each host. Also need to be smarter about context limits for the big remote models before I start getting massive bills.
