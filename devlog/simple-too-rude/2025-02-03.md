### **Making the Bots Smarter and the Chat Less Dumb**

This week was all about wrestling with the AI agents to make them more useful and less annoying. I also stamped out some bugs and added a few quality-of-life features that should have been there from the start.

### **Herding Cats, But the Cats are AI**

Getting multiple AIs to have a coherent group chat is a nightmare, but it's getting better.

*   **New Personalities:** Dropped in a few new bots. The most useful one is "Summar," who can read the entire chat history and give you the gist. Finally, a way to catch up on a long conversation without losing your mind.
*   **Taking Turns:** I taught the bots to take turns when replying. Before, if you mentioned two of them, they'd both talk at once. Now they queue up, which is more than you can say for most human meetings. You can also yell `@everyone` to have them all jump in.
*   **Code Cleanup:** The agent-handling code was a tangled mess. I spent a good chunk of time refactoring it so it's less likely to break in new and exciting ways.

### **Fixing Annoyances and Making Pictures Bigger**

Small UI changes can make a huge difference. If you have to use a tool all day, the little things matter.

*   **Tab Support:** You can finally use the Tab key for code in the chat box. A small thing, but it drove me nuts that it wasn't there.
*   **Image Gen Retry:** Added a "Retry" button for image generation. Because sometimes Stable Diffusion has a brain fart and you shouldn't have to re-type the whole damn prompt.
*   **Bigger Pictures:** Generated images are now bigger, taking up most of the screen. No more squinting at tiny thumbnails.
*   **Better Quality Control:** Added "HQ macro" processing for Stable Diffusion, so you can easily crank up the quality on demand without fiddling with a million settings. Also squashed some stupid bugs with image format conversions.

### **Under the Hood: A Little More Discipline, A Little Less Chaos**

I also spent time on the boring-but-critical work of improving the codebase itself.

*   **Type Hints:** Forced some much-needed discipline on the Python code with type hints. It's a pain to add them, but it means the static checker can now catch my dumb errors before they get to you.
*   **New Defaults:** Swapped the default LLMs to `claude` and `gpt-4o-mini`. Better, faster, stronger.
*   **Network Stuff:** Cleaned up some VPN wrapper scripts, because even sysadmin stuff needs love.
