### Making the Chat App Smarter, Faster, and a Little More Opinionated

Another week, another pile of updates. I touched just about everything, from the AI personalities to the guts of the system that handle files and security. The goal is always the same: build a chat app that can do things no other app can.

**Smarter AIs and a Chat That's More Than Just Chat**
The AI agents got a lot smarter this week.

*   **Better Conversations:** I implemented "alternating context" so AIs like Perplexity's Sonar models can have a more natural back-and-forth conversation. They actually wait their turn to speak instead of just shouting into the void. Two new AI characters, Akane and Nixie, also joined the roster.
*   **A Built-in Text Editor:** You can now open, edit, and save files directly in a chat room. The app is smart enough to know a `.js` file from a `.py` file and give you the right tools.
*   **Pluggable Brains:** It's now way easier to plug in new remote LLMs (like Claude) and code execution sandboxes. The best part: you can update agent configs on the fly without restarting the whole damn thing.

**Better, Faster AI Art**
The image generation tools got a few necessary upgrades.

*   **Reproducible Art:** The system now saves the `seed` for every generated image. If you create a masterpiece, you can actually reproduce it instead of just praying to the RNG gods.
*   **Faster Updates:** Sped up image results by polling 10x faster (every 0.1s instead of 1s). Less waiting, more creating.
*   **Cleaner Prompts:** Changed the negative prompt separator from `--` to `NEGATIVE`. It's just a cleaner syntax.

**Under the Hood: Taming Linux and My Own Code**
A lot of work went into the core system to make it more robust and usable.

*   **System Tools:** Added a script to switch PulseAudio outputs, because desktop Linux is still a frontier town for usability. Also added some tools for keeping an eye on resource-hungry processes.
*   **File Safety:** The app won't choke on filenames that start with a dash (`-`) anymore, and it now treats `.PNG` the same as `.png`. Basic stuff, but it has to be done.
*   **Citations and Safety:** Hooked up citation support for the Perplexity API, so you can see where it gets its facts. Also added better content and adult filtering flags for agents.
*   **Code Cleanup:** The usual refactoring and adding of type annotations continues. It's the programming equivalent of eating your vegetables.
*   **Web Server Tweaks:** Poked Nginx to send the right CORS headers so `chat.allemande.ai` can talk to the server without the browser throwing a fit.
