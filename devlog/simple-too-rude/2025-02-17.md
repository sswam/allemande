### **Herding AI Agents is Now Less of a Shitshow**

I finally ripped out the old, hard-coded AI agent list. Now they're all defined in simple config files (YAML, of course). This means adding or tweaking an AI character no longer requires a full-on code changeâ€”it's dynamic, as it should have been from the start. This also lets me fine-tune the default context and models we use, which will hopefully cut down on API costs.

I also added better visual prompts and prompt-building tips for the image-gen AIs. Because "a cute cat" gets you garbage, but "a photorealistic ginger tabby cat sleeping in a sunbeam, detailed fur, shallow depth of field" gets you art.

### **The Webchat is Now Slightly Less Janky**

Fixed a bunch of small, annoying things in the chat interface. A lot of it was wrestling with cross-origin crap so rooms actually load properly from different domains. I also beat some dependencies into submission (looking at you, D3 and Graphviz) so you can render charts and graphs in chat again without everything exploding.

You can also now inject custom HTML directly into the `<head>` or `<body>` of a chat room. If you want to load a custom font or some wacky JavaScript, have at it. Why not? The system shouldn't get in your way.

### **Bringing Some Go-Powered Sanity to the Backend**

Ported a text alignment tool from Python to Go. It's not that Python is bad, but for this kind of low-level text crunching, Go just feels cleaner and faster. Plus, it's a good excuse to write more Go.

While I was at it, I wrote a new tool to find and link duplicate files, because storing the same damn thing 50 times over is a waste of space and just plain stupid. I also hooked up the Google Search and Image APIs, so the agents can pull in real-time info instead of being completely clueless about anything that happened after 2023.

### **General Code Janitor Duty**

As usual, a lot of time was spent just cleaning up the codebase. Modernizing old code, adding type hints so my editor stops yelling at me, and simplifying some of the C linting rules. I also made the `secrets.sh` file optional so the app doesn't crash if you're just running a local test build without it. Finally, I dialed back the logging from the "conductor" service from "info" to "debug" so the logs are actually readable and not just a wall of useless noise.
