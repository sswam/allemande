### Wrangling the AI Zoo
The agent system was a mess, so I tore it down and rebuilt it. Now there's a proper structure for handling individual agents (`Agent`) and the whole collection (`Agents`). This makes it way easier to add new personalities without breaking everything. Speaking of which, say hello to **Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Buffy, Willow, and Xena**. Existing bots got smarter and their context windows were boosted, so they should be less forgetful. The whole system for loading and configuring them is just plain better now.

### Forcing the AI to Draw the Same Damn Character Twice
One of the most annoying things about AI image generation is consistency. You'd ask for a character and get a different person in the next frame. I've now broken down the visual descriptions into more granular parts (`clothes`, `age`, `mood`, etc.). This gives me way more control and leads to more consistent characters. On a related note, the Vision API support got a big upgrade, so it can now properly handle and resize images from different providers like OpenAI and Anthropic without choking.

### Making the Webchat Less Annoying
The user management script was a pain, so I rewrote it from scratch. This makes it much easier to add new users, set up their themes, and—importantly—manage their access to NSFW content. Getting started is now simpler for new folks. I also added a few other quality-of-life tweaks, like better keyboard navigation with subfolders and an option for users to control how much of their image history is kept in the chat. Small things that make a big difference.

### Spring Cleaning and a New Magic Tag
Lots of under-the-hood work this week. The coolest new feature is a `<think keep=1>` tag. This lets an AI agent hold a private thought in its context for the next prompt, without ever showing it to the user. It's great for maintaining a complex chain of thought across turns.

Beyond that, I did a lot of janitorial work:
-   Updated the intro docs with proper safety warnings and help commands.
-   Fixed a nasty race condition in a file monitoring script (`atail.py`).
-   Improved Markdown and code block rendering.
-   Cleaned up a bunch of shell scripts so they're less of a nightmare to use.
