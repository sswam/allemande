### A week of a thousand tiny fixes.

Instead of some giant, flashy new feature, this week was about sanding down the rough edges. It's the boring, thankless work of fixing a hundred little annoyances that, added up, makes the platform actually pleasant to use instead of a janky mess.

### Making our AI puppets less generic.

We're giving our agents more detailed character visuals by splitting clothing into 'upper' and 'lower' body categories. It's a small thing, but it stops the image generator from putting a character in a tuxedo jacket and swim trunks (unless you want that). To round it out, we've added a cast of new characters—including Big Bird, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump—so you can now get questionable advice from an even wider range of personalities.

### Our webchat is starting to suck less.

Most web UIs are a bloated disaster. We're fighting back.
*   **Code blocks in chat finally have syntax highlighting**, because monochrome code is an abomination.
*   There's a new **compact view** for mobile that stops the keyboard from eating half your screen.
*   Power users can now rename or move rooms with **`Alt+M`** instead of clicking through a dozen menus.
It's just common sense stuff that other apps are too lazy to implement.

### Fixing the plumbing so the whole thing doesn't explode.

A lot of work went into making things more stable. We hunted down and fixed a nasty race condition where the server would try to read a file while another process was still writing to it. We also ripped out the standard PyYAML library and replaced it with **`ruamel.yaml`**, because it doesn't butcher the formatting and comments in our config files—a win for simple, readable data formats. We also added CTranslate2 and whisperx for better performance, with CUDA enabled.

### And all the other crap.

We added some **quick-start guides**, because telling new users to "just figure it out" is a dick move. We also made a ton of tiny quality-of-life fixes, like adding a proper 'up' arrow to the folder icon and changing the `slim` visual tag to `skinny` because it's just better. The little stuff matters.
