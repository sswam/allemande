### My chat app's AI art is now less of a random crapshoot.

This week was all about giving users actual control over image generation instead of just rolling the dice and hoping for the best. The main event was adding regional prompting, which is a fancy way of saying you can finally tell the AI *where* to put things in the picture. Naturally, I also threw in some new art models and a mountain of other fixes because the work never ends.

**Finally, you can tell the AI what to draw, and *where*.**
The biggest update is regional prompting in the A1111 client. Tired of prompts like "a cat on the left and a dog on the right" giving you a two-headed cat-dog in the middle of the frame? Now you can divide the canvas into regions (rows, columns) and give each one its own separate prompt. This lets you build complex scenes with way more control. I also wrote up a guide on how to use it, so people have half a chance of figuring it out.

**More AI "artists" join the team.**
I've wired up a few more art models to give people more stylistic choice.
*   **Hily:** Based on `LEOSAM's HelloWorld XL`, great for fantasy and concept art.
*   **Dily:** Uses `dreamshaperXL`.
*   **Wili:** Uses `betterThanWords`.
Both Dily and Wili are solid SDXL-based models for general use. I also added a new "anime3d" visual style and improved the negative prompts for the existing "anime" and "photo" styles to get rid of some common junk.

**And the usual mountain of tweaks and fixes.**
A ton of smaller things got done across the platform.
*   **Agents:** The AI characters got a tune-up. I added a new agent, **Gemmi**, powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro, and improved the instructions that define the other agents' personalities. Fixed a dumb bug where local agent visuals wouldn't update.
*   **Docs:** Wrote more docs, including a new basics guide for AI art. Also wrote a piece on why structured output from LLMs should use markdown, because I'm sick of seeing people try to force JSON into places it doesn't belong.
*   **Chat UI:** You can now click the title of a code block to copy it. A few other minor CSS and display bugs were squashed.
*   **Backend:** The usual janitorial work. Fixed a macro parsing bug, made file monitoring actually notice symlink changes (thanks, `awatch -L`), and added some packages to the Debian build. Basically, keeping the lights on.
