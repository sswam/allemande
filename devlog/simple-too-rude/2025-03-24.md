### Making other chat apps look obsolete, one feature at a time.

A big week for Ally Chat. We're not just tweaking things; we're adding whole new categories of tools that you won't find anywhere else. The focus was on making the chat more powerful for creating thingsâ€”whether that's diagrams, AI art, or just coherent conversations.

**Your chat box is now a whiteboard and an art studio.**
The biggest new toy is **Mermaid diagram support**. If you've ever needed to sketch out a flowchart or sequence diagram, you can now do it right in the chat with simple text, just like you already could with Graphviz. It's built right in, no plugins needed.

The **AI art generator** also got a serious tune-up.
*   **More Models:** Added a bunch of new art models (Broni, Chilli, Furii, and more).
*   **Smarter Prompting:** Major upgrades to regional prompting, which lets you tell the AI *exactly where* to put things in the picture. No more hoping the cat ends up on the left side of the image; now you can command it.
*   **Shortcuts:** Got tired of typing out image dimensions? Now you can just use shortcuts like `[L3]` for a high-quality landscape image. Simple.

**Making the bots less annoying and the humans less clumsy.**
AI agents should be helpful, not overwhelming.
*   I toned down the bot personalities on first contact so they don't come on too strong. They'll reveal more personality as you talk to them. I also removed the Trump and Musk agents; they were more trouble than they were worth.
*   Because everyone makes typos, you can now **edit your messages** and even use a **soft undo** to take back your last action. It's a basic quality-of-life feature that should have been there sooner.

**Under the Hood: The plumbing and wiring.**
A lot of work went into stuff you might not see, but will definitely feel.
*   **New Brains:** Hooked up the new DeepSeek chat and reasoner models, and upgraded our main Gemini model to 2.5 Pro.
*   **Better Manners:** Taught the LLMs to shut up and not imitate other people in the chat by adding stop sequences. This prevents the AI from continuing the conversation as if it were you.
*   **UI Tweaks:** Made the send button bigger for fat fingers on mobile. I also hid the `access.yml` room permission files by renaming them to `.access.yml` to keep them out of sight from casual snooping.
