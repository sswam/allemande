### **Buried in the code mines, but the shiny bits are worth it.**

I basically forgot the sun existed this week. It was a heads-down, brute-force-productivity kind of week, focused on making Ally Chat less of a pain to use, giving the AI a bigger brain, and automating my own damn workflow so I can move faster.

#### **Making the Chat App Less Annoying**

A user interface should get out of your way, not fight you. The webchat got a bunch of overdue quality-of-life fixes.

*   **Better Navigation:** Added proper scrolling controls and menus for managing chat rooms. No more endless scrolling to find something from yesterday or fumbling to copy a conversation.
*   **Simple Mode:** Not everyone needs all the knobs and dials. There's now a "simple mode" that hides the advanced stuff for a cleaner look. You can still upload files, though.
*   **Actual Readability:** Switched the font to IBM Plex Sans. You can finally tell the difference between an uppercase 'I' and a lowercase 'l', which is a depressingly low bar that many fonts fail to clear.
*   **Backend Magic:** Reworked the service workers to make caching and updates more reliable. The app should load faster and update itself properly without you having to hit refresh like a maniac.

#### **Giving the AI a Bigger Brain (and Better Instructions)**

The built-in AI agents got a significant upgrade. It's not just about what they can do, but how easily you can tell them to do it.

*   **More Models:** Plugged Ally Chat into OpenRouter, giving it access to a wider range of AI models like Mavi and Skout. More choice is always better.
*   **Smarter Image Prompts:** Taught the image-making AI to understand prompts better. This means better quality settings, useful shortcuts for dimensions, and clearer instructions for getting what you actually want.
*   **Markdown `include`:** This is a neat one. You can now use an `include` command in a markdown block to pull in content from a file or a URL right into the chat. It shows the source and tucks the content away neatly in an expandable box.

#### **Automating the Boring Crap So I Can Code More**

I hate repetitive tasks. If I have to type the same command more than a few times, I'm going to automate it.

*   **Git Sanity:** Wrote a bunch of simple wrappers and aliases for Git. No more typing the same long-winded shit over and over for diffs, adds, and status checks. There's even a helper that converts pesky `https` clone URLs to `ssh`.
*   **Herding Script Cats (AMPS):** Started work on an experimental tool I'm calling AMPS (Actor Model Programming Shell). It's designed to help manage complex programs that are composed of many small, interconnected shell scripts. Think of it as a way to define dependencies and make sure everything runs in the right order without going insane.

#### **And Finally, Taking Out the Trash**

A lot of time was spent on janitorial duty. This is the unglamorous work that keeps the project from collapsing under its own weight. It involved cleaning up dependencies, improving build scripts, and, most importantly, splitting the monolithic `chat.py` file into smaller, more manageable pieces. A necessary evil.
