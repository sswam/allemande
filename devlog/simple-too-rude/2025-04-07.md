### This Week: More Models, Less Bugs, and a Sanity Check for the AIs

It was a real sprint week to get back in the flow. The main focus was cramming more AI models into Ally Chat, fixing annoying markdown bugs, and generally making things a little less broken.

#### More AI Brains to Pick
Ally Chat's strength is its model variety. It's not a walled garden where you're stuck with one company's AI. This week, I hooked up a few new ones:

*   **Alibaba Qwen:** Added support for Alibaba's powerful Qwen models, including their big 72B model. More options are always better.
*   **Google's Gemma:** The new open-source models from Google are now available through the OpenRouter connection.
*   **Gemini & OpenRouter:** Refined the configurations to provide backup endpoints for Gemini. If Google's API is having a bad day, the app can try an alternative.

#### Making Your Text Not Look Like Garbage
Markdown is great, right up until it isn't. I spent time fixing a bunch of annoying rendering issues that were making chats look ugly.

*   **Math & Code:** Your inline math (`$E=mc^2$`) and code blocks won't break the layout anymore. Nothing worse than sharing a code snippet and having the formatting get mangled.
*   **Tables:** The code that converts Markdown tables to other formats was rewritten to be more reliable. It's a small thing, but it stops the app from crashing on weirdly formatted tables.
*   **LaTeX:** For the real math nerds, I added client-side KaTeX rendering. Now you can throw complex LaTeX formulas directly into chat and they'll look right.

#### Keeping the Agents Sane and Safe
A bit of housekeeping on the AI agents. I got tired of weirdly specific or inconsistent character details.

*   **Age Standardization:** Everyone defaults to 23 years old now. It's simple and avoids problems.
*   **Safety Guardrails:** I added a few lines of code to the image-generation prompts. The goal is to strongly encourage the AIs to draw adults, not kids. A necessary, if slightly annoying, bit of safety coding.

#### Better Tools for You and Me
A few quality-of-life improvements were added for both users and for my own sanity.

*   **Editor Buttons:** There's a new "dedent" button in the editor. Small change, big convenience when working with code.
*   **GPU Watcher:** I wrote a simple script (`nvidia_usage.py`) to see which AI process is hogging all the GPU memory.
*   **Firewall Script:** A new command-line tool to more easily manage remote user access.

#### What's Next
The grind doesn't stop. I'll keep tweaking the AIs and their personalities. I'm also looking at user suggestions, and one that caught my eye is adding text-to-speech for math formulas. Could be a fun challenge. We'll see.
