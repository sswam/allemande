### This week was all about the un-glamorous work of making things *actually install and run*.

A lot of software development isn't about shiny new features, it's about wrestling with the plumbing so the whole thing doesn't fall over. This week was mostly plumbing.

*   **Fixing the goddamn installer.** Getting complex software to install correctly is a special kind of hell. I spent a ton of time patching up the install scripts (`web_install.sh`, `allemande_install.sh`) to properly handle web server configs (`nginx`), domain names, and security tokens (`JWT`). It should now be a much less painful experience for new users.

*   **Expanding the AI asylum with new personalities.** The main point of Ally Chat is talking to multiple AIs at once. We've added two new recruits:
	*   **Rocki**, a new agent running on the powerful Grok-3 model.
	*   And for reasons I can't fully defend, a **Borat** agent powered by a Llama model. *Very nice!*

*   **Making the app less of a mess and easier to use.**
	*   A lot of time went into refactoring and cleaning up the codebase. This is the janitorial work of programmingâ€”organizing functions, improving internal tools, and adding tests so things are less likely to explode later.
	*   On the user-facing side, you now have more control. There's a new 3-level compact view to kill screen clutter, plus some basic audio controls for text-to-speech. And I fixed that annoying scrolling bug.
