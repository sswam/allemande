### This week in Ally Chat: A more helpful help system, and smarter (less stupid) AI.

Spent the week fighting the good fight against clunky interfaces and bots that talk to themselves. The goal is always the same: make the app more powerful for experts without scaring off newcomers. A lot of user-facing improvements landed, along with some necessary janitorial work on the backend.

**The Shiny Bits (What you'll actually notice):**
We've made some big changes to how you interact with the app, especially when you're lost.
*   **The help widget is no longer a prison.** You can now drag it, resize it, and keep it open while you work. It's actually helpful now, with its own controls for undo, retry, and clearing chat.
*   **No more endless scrolling.** For those monster chat sessions, there's a new Table of Contents sidebar to help you find that one message from three days ago.
*   **Choose your difficulty.** New "simple," "advanced," and "boffin" view modes let you hide or reveal controls depending on how deep you want to go.
*   **Feels more native on iOS.** Added a pull-to-refresh gesture, because apps should just work the way you expect.

**The AI Brains (Making them work better):**
The agents got a tune-up to improve their performance and stop them from getting into arguments with themselves.
*   **New personalities on board:** Welcome Fli, Gemm, and Evan to the character roster. Poli and Summi also got an upgrade to Google's new `gemini-2.5-flash` model.
*   **Agents no longer talk to themselves.** I refactored the agent handling to stop them from accidentally invoking each other in a chaotic loop. Now they only call on another agent if you explicitly tag them with `@`. Much cleaner.
*   **Work-in-progress:** Started building Gily, a new image generation agent using OpenAI. More on that soon.

**Under the Hood (Boring but important stuff):**
Did some janitorial work on the server to improve security, performance, and make my own life easier.
*   **Nginx lockdown:** Tightened up server security by blocking web access to hidden `/.` files and simplifying CORS rules.
*   **Fighting the cache:** Added a simple rewrite rule (`file.hash.ext` -> `file.ext`) to force your browser to load the latest version of the app's files. No more "have you tried clearing your cache?" bullshit for bugs I already fixed.
*   **Killed a stupid Firefox bug.** The service worker was causing random disconnects on the `rooms` subdomain, so I disabled it there. Problem solved.
*   **General cleanup:** Added scripts to clean up old images, audit remote users, and sync system passwords. Clean code is happy code.
