### A week of polishing the chrome and reinforcing the walls.

Not every week is about shipping some flashy new AI feature. Sometimes you have to fix the annoying little papercuts that drive users crazy and do the boring-but-critical work of hardening the backend. This was one of those weeks.

A lot of focus went into the user experience—making the app less of a headache for new users and more efficient for regulars. We also did some important work under the hood to improve security and system stability. It’s not glamorous, but it keeps the lights on and the script kiddies out.

Here’s the rundown:

*   **Fixing Annoying Shit:** We squashed a bunch of UI bugs. You can no longer accidentally send a message to a directory (why was that even possible?). The tab key now behaves correctly after autocompleting, instead of jumping your cursor to the start of the line. And we added scrolling buttons to the editor for people who write way too much.
*   **A Better Welcome:** New users now get a `light.css` theme by default, and a one-time intro that points a big, obvious arrow at the help button. No more excuses for not reading the manual.
*   **Audio & AI Upgrades:** The app’s audio transcription tool (`whisper_cpp`) can now directly translate foreign language audio to English with a simple `--task translate` flag. We also added support for FLAC audio files, because some people are serious about their lossless audio.
*   **Security & Stability:** We built a proper standalone monitoring script to keep an eye on server health (disk, CPU, memory). More importantly, we added scripts for locking down remote users in their own sandboxed cages (chroot jails). This improves security and lets us control their resource usage so they can’t grind the whole server to a halt.
*   **The Nerd Stuff:** Updated the build process to use CTranslate2 v4.4.0. We also refactored the crusty old `ffclip` script into a proper function with input validation, which should have been done ages ago.
