### Making the AI Zoo Less of a Goddamn Mess

As the list of AI personalities in Ally Chat grows, so does the complexity behind the scenes. This week was about taming that chaos. We focused on making the agents smarter and more organized, while also fixing some seriously annoying backend issues that were making the whole system fragile. If you're going to build a platform this flexible, you have to keep the foundation from turning into a pile of crap.

**The Puppets Get a Brain Upgrade**
The biggest effort was on the AI agents themselves. A disorganized pile of config files is a recipe for disaster and makes it impossible to add new things without breaking old ones.
*   **New Faces & a Cleanup:** We added some new characters (Baymax, Riley, and others) and kicked out a few that weren't working well. More importantly, we finally stopped dumping all the agent definitions into one giant folder. They're now sorted into proper subdirectories (`character`, `art`, `search`, etc.) so we can find things without wanting to tear our hair out.
*   **Smarter Prompt Templating:** The real magic is a new `replace_variables` utility. It lets us build complex prompts by swapping in variables on the fly, *without* mangling code blocks inside the prompt. This was critical for a new "Chaz" specialist agent that can now spit out complete, ready-to-use character templates on its own.
*   **Model Upgrades:** We also updated agents to use the latest Grok-2/3 models from xAI. Gotta keep up.

**Fixing Our Shitty Network Mounts**
Relying on network shares is always a gamble, and our old mounting script was a bit of a muppet. It would sometimes fail or try to run twice at the same time, leaving models and other critical files unavailable. The new `ally_mount.sh` script is less stupid. It uses a lock file to stop it from running over itself, and it now properly verifies the connection is actually alive before declaring victory. This makes starting up the AI services much more reliable.

**Minor Fixes that Keep Us Sane**
A few other things got fixed to improve stability and make life easier.
*   **Image Gen That Doesn't Just Quit:** AI image generation can be flaky. If the service times out, we now automatically retry a few times with a backoff delay instead of just giving up and showing an error. More art, less frustration.
*   **Don't Nuke the Help File:** We fixed a dumb bug where the system would overwrite a user's custom `help.bb` file. Now it only copies the default help text if you don't already have one. Simple stuff that shouldn't have been a problem in the first place.
*   **Documentation is a Necessary Evil:** Nobody likes writing it, but it has to be done. We overhauled the guides and added an auto-generated character list so you can actually see all the available personalities without digging through config files. New users also get a "tour" offer to help them get started.
