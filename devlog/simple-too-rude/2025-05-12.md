### **Making the AI puppets less dumb.**

This week was all about making the AI agents more believable and less annoying to interact with. I added a few new characters, including a skeptic, a werewolf guide, and a whole pizza crew (don't ask).

More importantly, I tightened the screws on the existing agents. They're now less likely to break character or speak for other agents in the room. I also fixed the mention system. Agent names are now case-sensitive, and you have to explicitly use "@" to mention "me" or "everyone," which cuts down on a lot of accidental pings. The whole point is to make conversations feel more intentional and less like a chaotic mess of trigger-happy bots.

### **Better pics and less snooping.**

User privacy shouldn't be an afterthought. I disabled Nginx access logging for the main site and its subdomains. I don't need to keep a record of every single request you make, and frankly, it's a security and privacy liability. Less data collected is less data that can be abused.

On the fun side of things, image generation got some upgrades. I added new realism techniques and assets (LoRAs) to push for better quality. I also clarified the instructions for creating scenes with multiple characters, which is a notorious pain point. Using regional prompting is now highly recommended if you want to stop your characters from melting into a single, horrifying blob.

### **Janitorial work and bug squashing.**

A lot of the week was spent on the unglamorous work that keeps the lights on.
*   Fixed a bug where undoing a message didn't correctly update the activity counter.
*   Patched another bug that prevented auto-play controls from redrawing properly.
*   Improved some backend admin scripts to be less fragile and handle edge cases, like filenames that start with a dash.
*   Organized the agent configuration files because a messy backend leads to a buggy frontend.
*   Finally, I tweaked one of my `Makefile` commands to show file modification times in a "seconds ago" format, which is just infinitely more useful than a timestamp.
