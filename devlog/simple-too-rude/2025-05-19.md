### **This week in Ally Chat: Better AI art, smarter AIs, and fixing broken shit.**

A good week of solid progress. I bolted on a new, top-tier AI model, made the image generation more realistic so it sucks less, and squashed a few annoying bugs that were getting on my nerves.

#### **Making AI-generated images less fake**

I'm always chasing more realism in the image generator. It's a constant battle against plastic-looking faces and weird artifacts.
*   **New 'real' style:** I ripped out the old 'realism' setting and replaced it with a much better `[use real]` style. It combines special tags and LoRAs (think of them as tiny AI plugins for specific looks) to push for photorealism.
*   **Fixing hands (or trying to):** I made another attempt to fix the AI's weird obsession with drawing mangled hands. I told the AI "no bad hands" in the negative prompt, but it didn't really work, so I took it out again. The fight continues.
*   **Tweaks:** Standardized some of the internal tags for the PonyXL model to keep things consistent.

#### **Bigger Brains for the Bots**

More models means more options. If one AI is being dumb, you can just ask another one.
*   **Claude 4 Opus is in:** You can now chat with Anthropic's latest and greatest model, Claude 4 Opus. It's available as the 'Claudo' agent and it's ridiculously powerful.
*   **Housekeeping:** Renamed the internal model key for `claude-new` to the more accurate `claude-sonnet` and updated the Gemini model details. Just keeping things tidy.

#### **Janitorial Duty: Fixes and Tweaks**

A platform is only as good as its small details. Some stuff was just broken or annoying.
*   **Annoying image swipe is gone:** The image viewer was annoying as hell if you used a mouse. I disabled the drag-to-swipe feature for mouse users, so you won't accidentally swipe to the next image anymore.
*   **Script fixes:** Made some backend scripts for user management and security more robust. One now correctly ignores hidden files and another checks that required tools are installed before it tries to run.
