### **Making AI faces that don't all look the same.**

A big focus this week was pulling our image generation out of the uncanny valley of generic, plastic-looking people. The default AI face is boring, so we gave it a lot more nuance.

*   **Real-world diversity:** We implemented race-aware generation. This isn't just a simple skin-tone slider; it's about adding appropriate facial features, eye colors, and hairstyles that match. No more generic defaults for everyone.
*   **More emotion:** The AIs can now specify emotions like "happy" or "angry" in their prompts, and we're using special LoRAs (think of them as small, specialized style plugins) to make sure the emotion actually shows up on the character's face.
*   **Better age control:** Added more specific age ranges like "young adult" and "middle age," and fine-tuned the prompts so a 40-year-old doesn't look like a 20-year-old with a few lines drawn on.
*   **Celebrity faces & Ponies:** For fun, we added support for LoRAs of female celebrities, so you can generate characters that look like specific actresses. We also threw in a whole system for generating Pony-style characters, complete with their own specific builds and negative prompts to keep the art clean.

### **Expanding the AI cast: Now with more personality (and less bullshit).**

We added a few new agents to the chat roster because a good team needs different specialists.

*   **Dax:** A quirky, humorous agent for when you want a less serious take.
*   **Eli:** The explainer. Designed to take complex topics and break them down into simple terms for anyone to understand.
*   **Clair:** The anti-AI. Built to use plain, direct language and avoid the usual robotic, overly polite phrasing that plagues most LLMs.

We also tweaked some of the existing agents, making them better at their jobsâ€”like getting Pixi to stop adding empty image prompts when you're just trying to have a conversation.

### **A new toy for tab hoarders and other backend fixes.**

Like most programmers, my browser is a mess of tabs. I finally got fed up and built a simple browser extension to export all tabs in a window to a clean TSV file. Now I can archive a research session instead of leaving 50 tabs open to rot.

Beyond that, a lot of work went into general housekeeping and fixing annoying little bugs:

*   **Longer AI thinking time:** Increased the local agent timeout to 10 minutes. This prevents the AI from giving up halfway through a complex task, like writing a long piece of code or generating a detailed story.
*   **Smarter AI chatter:** Added a feature to prevent AIs from getting stuck in an endless back-and-forth conversation with each other. Now there's a "chance" setting that gates their non-tool replies.
*   **The usual janitorial work:** Fixed folder views from clipping in Firefox, stopped the server from trying to kill processes that don't exist, improved how we handle URLs with special characters, and made sure our tab exporter properly ends its files with a newline. The boring stuff that keeps the whole thing from falling apart.
