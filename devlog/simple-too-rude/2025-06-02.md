### **This week, the AI agents got a brain transplant.**

Mostly backend work this week, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. But the result is a smarter, more flexible system that's less likely to fall over. We ripped out old parts, upgraded the engine, and gave our roster of AI characters some serious enhancements.

*   **The Agent Overhaul:** The big focus was on how we manage AI agents. Instead of defining them all over the place like a bunch of muppets, we now have a global file for shared characters. Define once, use everywhere. Simple. This is how it should have been from the start.
	*   We added a new character design specialist, **Chas**, who helps you create new characters and can even use reference images.
	*   A tough cop named Cassie and six other new faces joined the cast. We also gave the boot to Gemmy, whose model is now obsolete. We don't keep legacy crap around.

*   **Under the Hood:** We updated a ton of dependencies because staying current is non-negotiable.
	*   PyTorch is now on the latest version. We also split the install so you can get a build specifically for your hardware: plain CPU, NVIDIA (CUDA), or AMD (ROCm). No more downloading bloated packages for hardware you don't own.
	*   Google decided to change their Gemini SDK, so we updated to their new `google.genai` library. Just another day of keeping up with the whims of tech giants.

*   **Making Better Pictures:** Our image agents got some cool new tricks.
	*   The **Illu** agent can now use "pretty" and "ugly" LoRAs. This gives you way more control over the vibe, from supermodel to swamp creature. Your choice.
	*   A quick tip for writing prompts: The AI is literal and kind of dumb. Don't write `long wavy brown hair`. Instead, write `long hair, wavy hair, brown hair`. Chaining single adjectives works better. It's stupid, but it's what we've got to work with.

*   **Final Thought:** We added a new guiding principle for our AI development: **simplicity over correctness.** A simple, clear plan that the AI can execute is infinitely better than a "technically correct" but over-engineered mess that no human can debug. Let the machine sweat the small stuff.
