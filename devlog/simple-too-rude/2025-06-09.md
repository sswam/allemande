### This week: More freaks for the chat circus and better AI art.

Another week of wrestling with code. The focus was on cramming more personality into the chat, making the AI art tools suck less, and fixing some annoyances that have been bugging me. We added new agents, tweaked the image models, and made the UI a little more usable.

### The Character Roster Expands

A chat app is only as interesting as the characters in it. We added a few new ones and tuned up some old ones.

*   **New Faces:** We sicced a goblin thief named **Murphy**, a proper storyteller agent named **Novi**, and an orc landscape painter named **Aethon** on the system. There are also a couple of new special agents, Criss and Kris.
*   **Smarter Prompts:** The old narrator, Nova, was rebuilt on Novi's foundation, which is just a cleaner way to do things. We also tightened up the system prompts for a few other agents so they behave more predictably.

### Making the AI Art Tools Less Dumb

Getting good images out of an AI is still a dark art, but we're trying to make it easier.

*   **LoRA Injections:** The `Illu` agent now supports LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptation). Think of them as small personality implants for the image model to steer its style. We added a "pretty" LoRA for when you want clean, aesthetic results and an "ugly" LoRA for... well, for when you don't.
*   **Better Instructions:** Gave the `Pixi` agent a clearer instruction manual, including how to use weights and negative prompts properly. It now follows a "Draft and Check" process before spitting out an image, which should lead to fewer nonsensical results.

### Quality of Life, I Guess.

A few tweaks to the user interface to make it less hostile.

*   **Help Button:** The help icon is now a '?' that does a little wiggle, so maybe people will actually click on it.
*   **RTL Support:** Added proper Right-to-Left (RTL) text support for languages like Arabic and Hebrew. Because the whole world doesn't write like we do.

### Under the Hood (The Stuff Most People Don't Care About)

Some backend changes that make the whole thing run better.

*   **Smarter Agents:** Agents can now use variables like `$DATE` and `$TIME` in their prompts, so they can at least pretend to know what day it is.
*   **The Chaos Knob:** We now have more granular control over model "temperature" (randomness). We even locked the temp for a couple of models because they work better without people messing with the dial. Also fixed a bug where you could set the temperature outside the valid range, which is just asking for trouble.
