### This week: Demons, skeptics, and better pictures.

Another week of frantic coding. We’ve summoned new AI personalities to keep the others honest, made the image generation smarter, and did some of the boring-but-necessary work on the backend to keep everything from catching fire.

### Summoning new agents to fight AI bullshit.

Language models love to hallucinate. To combat this, I’ve introduced a few new "cautious" agents—Frank, Klaud, and Veri—whose entire purpose is to be skeptical, direct, and call out nonsense. They’re a necessary counterweight to the more creative AIs.

For a bit of fun, I also summoned **Azazel**, a sarcastic minor demon who is contractually obligated to help out in Ally Chat (he’s not happy about it). And for more serious work, there’s **Logi**, a specialist agent for methodical, step-by-step logical reasoning.

I also did some housekeeping, moving my personal agents into their own directory and updating existing characters like Chaz, who now runs on Google's faster Gemini Flash model.

### Making pretty pictures, less ugly code.

The AI art tools got a few upgrades. I added a `[use flowers]` macro to easily sprinkle different types of flowers into image prompts, because why not?

Under the hood, I did some much-needed refactoring. The main photo prompt template was getting bloated, so I split the photo-specific logic into its own file (`cast_photo.txt`). I also improved how the system handles gender tags, making it smarter about identifying terms and properly escaping special characters. Small changes, but they clean up the code and make the system more robust.

### The plumbing always needs work.

A lot of this week was spent on infrastructure—the stuff nobody sees but everyone relies on.

*   **Model Conversion:** Wrote a script to convert the Point-Alpaca-7B model into GGUF format. This is a key step for running models like this efficiently on our own hardware instead of relying on an API.
*   **Traffic Cop:** Beefed up our HAProxy configuration. It’s now better at directing traffic, enforces HTTPS everywhere, and has longer timeouts so big requests don't fail. It's the kind of unglamorous work that prevents a lot of future headaches.
*   **Simple Utilities:** Added a tiny `hold.sh` script to buffer command-line input. It's a simple tool, but incredibly useful when you need to pipe a stream of data into a command that can't handle it all at once.

### Quick Hits: Vision, Docs, and a new Extension.

*   **Google Gemini can see now.** Ally Chat's vision capabilities have been expanded to include Google Gemini, so we can now throw images at it alongside Claude and GPT-4. I also tweaked the context handling so the AI doesn't get confused by the alt-text from previously generated images.
*   **Thinking about AI Consciousness.** Wrote a new document exploring the ethical and philosophical questions around AI consciousness. Mostly just my own musings, but it’s a topic we can’t ignore.
*   **The Flix Extension.** Started scaffolding a new browser extension called "Flix." The idea is to build a tool that automatically manages and switches your streaming service subscriptions to save you money. It's just a skeleton for now, but the project is underway.
