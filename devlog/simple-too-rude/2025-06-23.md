### This week: A flood of new AI agents and way better art.

We're stuffing Ally Chat with more personalities than a high school drama club and giving you better tools to make them create weird art. The goal is to make the platform more useful, more fun, and a little bit weirder. We also did some boring but necessary work under the hood to keep things running smoothly.

### Meet the New Crew (and some old friends with new tricks)

A bunch of new faces showed up this week.
*   **Aidi** is our new tech support agent, here to help you figure out the UI and stop you from breaking things.
*   **Lyra** is a fitness coach who will probably yell at you to do more pushups.
*   **Misti**, **G-Chan**, and **Sixl** are new art bots. Misti specializes in furry/pony art, while G-Chan and Sixl focus on general AI art with SDXL.

We also added **Yenta**, a matchmaker who recommends other characters and tools. To keep her in the loop, we built a system that auto-generates summaries of all agents and injects it right into her brain (system prompt), so her advice is always fresh.

In other news, the agent "Tony" got a new job as **Nicc**, a pizza restaurant phone agent. Some Disney bots got the boot, and we told Flint to be less chatty on login.

### Art Generation Gets a Furry Upgrade

The big news for artists is official support for furry and pony art. Agents like Illu and Gemini Chan are now tuned for it. You can use simple tags like `[furry $Name]` or `[pony $Name]` to get the style you want.

We also standardized how negative prompts work. This gives you more control to get rid of things you *don't* want in your images, like bad text, watermarks, or creepy hands.

### Making Life Easier (and Safer)

A few quality-of-life updates to make the app less annoying:
*   **NSFW Gatekeeping:** We added a proper NSFW access check. If you're not supposed to be in the spicy rooms, you won't see the door. Simple as that.
*   **A Mission for Newbies:** New users now get a default `mission.m` file. It's basically a note that tells the AIs what you're trying to accomplish, so they can be more helpful out of the box.
*   **Clearer Help:** We clarified the help text. To talk to an AI, use a capital letter or the `@` symbol (e.g., `Aidi: help` or `@Aidi help`).

### Under the Hood: For the Nerds

For those who care about the guts of the system:
*   **Image Job Queue:** Image generation was a free-for-all. We implemented a priority queue that's fairer, considering how long a job takes and how much a user has been generating. No more waiting forever because someone is rendering an epic.
*   **GGUF Support:** Added initial support for GGUF models. This opens the door to running a wider variety of local LLMs efficiently on the GPU, which is a huge deal for performance and flexibility.
*   **Admin Scripts:** Wrote a few new shell scripts to audit users and fix broken directory structures. Boring but necessary work to keep the lights on and the user data clean.
