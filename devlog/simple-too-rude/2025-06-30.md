### After a 2-week break, the AI gets more personality (and shiny trading cards).

I’m back from vacation, and it turns out a little time off is great for productivity. This week’s focus was on giving the AI agents more distinct character and making the whole experience more visually polished. I’ve been joking about selling profile cards like Pokémon packs, and now I’m one step closer to making that a reality.

#### Key Updates:

*   **Holographic Profile Cards:** The old profile cards are gone. Now, they're 3D holographic trading cards. They have a cool tilt effect, a holographic shine, and the background automatically generates a gradient based on the dominant colors in the character's profile picture. They even respond to touch on mobile. It's completely unnecessary, but it looks awesome.

*   **An AI to Help Your AI:** I added a new agent, **Lyro**, who is basically an AI prompt-writing specialist. You use an AI to help you talk to other AIs better. Meta, I know. I also spent a ton of time refining existing agent prompts and giving them proper character data—bios, interests, likes, and dislikes—which feeds directly into their new profile cards.

*   **Better Image Generation:** Visuals got some much-needed love.
	*   **More image shapes:** You're no longer stuck with squares. I added a bunch of new aspect ratios like Tall and Wide for more creative freedom.
	*   **Plastic Clothes:** Added a "LoRA" (think of it as a style-specific mini-model) for generating realistic plastic clothing on characters.
	*   **Watercolor Portraits:** Added another new style for generating watercolor art.

*   **Backend & Housekeeping:** For the programmers in the audience, I added some new command-line tools to make my life easier, including scripts for creating relative symlinks. I also cleaned up the chat view by hiding all the boring system messages. It's less noise, more signal.
