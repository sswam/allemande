### Putting every AI in one chat room, because why the hell not?

I got sick of walled gardens. Every platform locks you into their one model, maybe two if you're lucky. You can't mix and match, you can't have them talk to each other, and you definitely can't embed a live JavaScript chart in a message. It's restrictive and, frankly, boring.

So I built [Ally Chat](https://allemande.ai) to be the opposite of that. It’s a multi-user chat platform where you can throw pretty much any AI model or tool into a room and see what happens. It's a sandbox, a productivity tool, and a chaotic playground all at once.

Here’s a taste of what makes it different from every other chat app out there:

*   **Chat with actual HTML.** In addition to basic markdown. We render full HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript in messages. You can embed videos, interactive diagrams, or just make your text obnoxiously glittery with a custom stylesheet. Your call.
*   **An AI ‘conductor’ to orchestrate the chaos.** You can mention AIs by name (`Emmy`, `Claude`, `Gemmi`) to get a response from a specific one. Mention several, and they can have a conversation. You direct the show.
*   **A ridiculous roster of AIs.** We’re closing in on 400 different models, characters, agents, and specialized tools from all the major players: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Perplexity, and more. If a new model drops, we're probably adding it.
*   **Real tools for technical people.** You can render Graphviz and Mermaid diagrams on the fly, work with mathematical notation, get coding help in many languages, and generate AI art with SDXL and PonyXL models right in the chat.
*   **You control the space.** We have a proper room system for private chats, public discussions, and personal sandboxes. We also believe in free speech, so there are clear NSFW options if you want them. No corporate nanny deciding what you're allowed to do or see.

The point is to build a powerful platform that doesn't treat its users like idiots. It's a tool for creators, programmers, and anyone who wants to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. It’s what I wanted for myself, and it turns out other people want it too.
