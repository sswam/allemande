**Voice Chat with AI Finally Works!**
Got the voice interaction pipeline working smoothly this week. Two scripts handle the magic:
- `bb-voice-1.sh` for basic chat
- `bb-voice-2.sh` for fancier stuff like resuming conversations
Using Whisper-large for speech recognition and some slick text-to-speech. The AI sounds pretty natural now, not like a robot having a stroke.

**GPT Tools Are Getting Scary Good**
Rebuilt the whole GPT tooling system. Now we've got specialized commands for everything:
- Code improvement and debugging
- Making flashcards and summaries
- Breaking down topics into tutorials
- Even an "insanify" mode (don't ask)
The core `gpt.py` got a major upgrade too - way more robust now.

**Video to Flashcards Because Why Not?**
Built a simple pipeline that grabs YouTube videos, transcribes them, and spits out flashcards. Perfect for cramming before exams or "learning" during Netflix binges.

**Quality of Life Improvements**
- Upgraded to GPT-4 for better responses
- Better voice recognition with Whisper-large
- Cleaned up all the Python code (pylint stopped crying)
- Added symlinks so you don't need to type full paths

This project is turning into something pretty amazing. The combination of voice, video, and smart GPT tools opens up some wild possibilities. And yes, I might actually sell AI-generated flashcard packs - Pokemon style. Gotta train 'em all!
