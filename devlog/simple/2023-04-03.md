**AI Assistant Project Gets Major Upgrades: Voice, Vision, and Text Processing**
Built a bunch of cool new features this week. Now the AI can see images, talk naturally, and handle text like a boss. Plus it switches between different AI models mid-conversation, which is pretty neat.

**Text Tools That Actually Make Sense**
Created a suite of command-line tools for text processing, all living in the `text/` directory:
- Handles everything from fixing blank lines to splitting giant text files
- Smart sentence splitter using spaCy and AI for those monster paragraphs
- Converts between formats like TSV, Markdown, HTML
- Even does cool stuff like reversing paragraphs and parsing word boundaries

**Voice Chat That Doesn't Suck**
Got the voice system working smoothly with three main parts:
- `bbv-1-brain.sh`: The AI brain that figures out what to say
- `bbv-2-mike.sh`: Turns your voice into text
- `bbv-3-speak.sh`: Makes the AI talk back
Added a quick mic mute toggle because nobody likes awkward hot mic moments.

**AI Vision: Because Text-Only is So 2022**
Added some serious image analysis power:
- Can generate masks to focus on specific parts of images
- Describes images in natural language using CLIP
- Works alongside text and voice features for true multimodal AI

**Model Switching Mid-Chat: Because Why Not?**
Built a script that lets you switch between different ChatGPT models while chatting. No more starting over just to try a different model. Just click and switch.

All this comes together to make a pretty sweet AI assistant that can see, hear, speak, and adapt on the fly. It's like having a super-smart friend who's really good at multitasking.

The code's clean, the tools are useful, and it's actually fun to use. Because if we're going to build AI assistants, they might as well be awesome.
