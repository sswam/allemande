**Major upgrades to core services and AI integration**
The core service got a big upgrade this week, making it faster and more efficient. We're now using Llama classes and have better file handling. Also added proper debugging options - because who doesn't love clean debugging?

**Claude AI joins the party**
Added support for Anthropic's Claude AI model, with both sync and async capabilities. The API integration is clean and fast, ready for all sorts of interesting applications.

**Voice chat gets smoother**
Fixed up the voice chat system:
- Moved everything into a dedicated directory (organization ftw!)
- Using a specific Tacotron2 model for better voice quality
- Fixed some quirky invitation formatting
- Renamed the launch script to something more sensible
- Disabled the hilariously overenthusiastic "emotional" mode by default (though you can still make it go ðŸ¤ª)

**New code summarization tools**
Built some cool tools to help understand complex codebases, starting with NetLogo:
- Splits code into digestible chunks
- Generates clear descriptions of functions
- Sorts code by dependencies
- Works with original file ordering when needed

**Better project management**
Created a `sync-project` script to handle git operations smoothly. No more manual branch juggling!

**Embedded language support**
Added support for embedding various interpreters (Python, Perl, Lua, Ruby, JS) in C code. Because sometimes you just need ALL the languages.

**General cleanup**
Lots of file reorganization and cleanup. Everything has its place now, and the codebase is much tidier. Even updated .gitignore to handle all our test files properly.

This week was all about making things work better together while keeping the codebase clean and organized. The new AI and code analysis tools are particularly exciting - can't wait to see what people build with them!
