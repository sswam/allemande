# Devlog: Week of 2023-04-17

The Allemande toolkit got some sweet upgrades this week. Added whisper.cpp support as an alternative to standard Whisper - it'll use the standard command if available, otherwise fall back to whisper.cpp from /opt/whisper.cpp. Could be faster, might use less resources.

Markdown security was a fun challenge. Had to lock down HTML rendering to prevent sneaky JavaScript execution. The markdown2html-safe scripts now use pandoc with a lua filter to sanitize everything. Added tests to make sure it actually works.

Built some cool async utilities - akeepalive.py and atail.py (plus a Go version). Think 'tail -f' but for async operations. The Python version is smart enough not to freak out when files get truncated.

The web UI is coming together nicely. It talks to voice chat now and plays well with core Allemande services. Added the allemande.py library so client programs can easily hook into everything. The chat-api.py script uses it to talk to the llm_llama service.

Created a proper Makefile because life's too short for manual builds. It handles all the core services (LLM, Whisper), voice chat stuff (brain, mike, speak), and web UI components. Moved some shell scripts to Python and cleaned up the directory structure.

Also threw in some polish - fixed OCR issues, added logging controls (debug spam is now optional), and included some banner images. Even added a poem example, because why not?

The whole thing is shaping up to be a pretty sweet toolkit. Still more to do, but it's getting there.
