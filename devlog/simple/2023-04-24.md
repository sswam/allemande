**Conductor Process and Project Improvements in Ally Chat**
Made some exciting progress this week - the chat system is getting smarter and easier to set up. The big news is the new "conductor" that lets multiple AI agents work together more smoothly. Think of it as an AI traffic controller for chat.

Key updates:
- Voice chat got better - you can now mute/unmute with a simple script, and the speech synthesis is clearer
- New setup scripts make installation a breeze (and cleanup is better too)
- Web UI has proper authentication now (basic but secure)
- Using screen sessions for better terminal management (with handy shortcuts)
- Documentation got some love, including pretty screenshots

On the technical side, we're now using the `ports` module instead of the old `allemande` module for audio handling, and the root permission checks are centralized. The conductor process lives in `chat/conductor.py` with supporting scripts in `brain.sh` and `llama-chat-3.py`.

Lots of small improvements too - better file syncing, smarter user directory creation, and cleaner log messages. Even added a timeout for those mic notifications so they don't hang around forever.

Next up: More work on the conductor to make our AI agents play even nicer together. The project's really coming together!
