# Devlog: Allemande Project Updates - May 2023

**Making the chat app more awesome across the board!** This week was packed with improvements to Allemande's documentation, web interface, voice features, and AI capabilities. The project's growing nicely, and I'm excited about where it's heading.

**Documentation got a facelift:** Added some slick banner images to the GitHub repos and cleaned up the READMEs. Also created a roadmap in `projects.md` so people can see where we're going with this.

**Web stuff is getting serious:** Set up proper Nginx and HAProxy configs for production deployment. Now we've got clean subdomains like `chat.allemande.ai` and `rooms.allemande.ai`. Made installation scripts that actually work (what a concept, right?).

**Voice chat keeps getting better:** Fixed that annoying feedback loop where the mic would pick up the AI's speech. Added thread-safe muting and tweaked the confidence threshold so it picks up actual speech better.

**AI integration is expanding beyond GPT:** Renamed a bunch of stuff from `openai` to `llm` because we're not playing favorites anymore. Added support for Claude models (with their fancy safety settings) and switched the default search from DuckDuckGo to Google because, let's face it, it works better.

**Added some handy table tools:** New utilities for converting between TSV, CSV, HTML, and other formats. Because everyone loves dealing with table data (okay, maybe not, but now it sucks less).

**Started work on a graph editor:** Beginning to add graphical editing to Ally Chat. Right now it's just experimenting with SVG stuff, but it's going to be cool.

**Other neat stuff:**
- Script to add hashbangs automatically (because typing `#!/usr/bin/env python` gets old)
- Better project sync tools
- Bunch of i3 window manager scripts for the Linux nerds
- Various cleanup and quality-of-life improvements

The code's getting cleaner, the features are getting cooler, and we're building something pretty awesome here. Stay tuned!
