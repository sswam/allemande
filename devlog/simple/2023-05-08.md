# Devlog: Making Ally Chat More Awesome ðŸš€

This week we added some cool features to make Ally Chat even more fun and powerful. Here's what's new:

**Fresh New Looks**: Added nature-inspired themes (autumn leaves, ocean vibes) and a dark rainbow theme that's pretty sweet. You can now randomize your theme with a simple `-f` flag if you're feeling lucky. The themes load smoothly without that annoying flash of unstyled content.

**Better Voice Chat**: Made the speech recognition more accurate by tweaking the microphone sensitivity. Added CUDA support so speech synthesis runs faster on gaming PCs. We're also working on integrating `whisper.cpp` for even better voice recognition.

**Video-to-Flashcards**: Built a slick web interface (using Gradio) that turns YouTube videos into study materials. The backend pipeline now handles audio cleanup and transcript processing like a champ. It's pretty neat - you just drop in a video URL and get flashcards!

**Quality of Life Updates**:
- Streamlined installation process
- Added auto-rotation for chat logs
- Created some handy git tools for developers
- Fixed various bugs in the chat engine
- Made the connection status updates less spammy

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Now you can enable CUDA for faster speech synthesis
speak.py --cuda True --download_all_models

# Random theme selection is just one flag away
user-set-theme.py -f

# Shortened the startup command
ln -s /webchat allychat
```

The video-to-flashcards feature is shaping up nicely. We reorganized the directory structure and improved how it handles URLs and processes audio. The web interface makes it super accessible even if you're not comfortable with the command line.

All in all, Ally Chat is getting smarter and more user-friendly every week. Can't wait to see what we build next! ðŸŽ¯
