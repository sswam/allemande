# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-15

Made some great progress this week! The Kanban board got proper drag-and-drop (finally!), added a bunch of handy AI tools, beefed up security, and polished up the Ikigai resume app.

**Kanban Board Gets Drag-and-Drop**
The board is way more intuitive now - you can grab items and drag them between columns. Added proper error handling too, so you'll know if something goes wrong instead of silently failing.

**New AI Tools**
Built a whole suite of AI scripts that make life easier:
- Direct LLM chat from your text editor
- Quick code explanation tool for devs
- One-line query tools for fast answers
- Wrappers for Claude, GPT-4, and Google's Bard
- Added retry logic to handle API hiccups

**Security Upgrade**
Implemented IP banning for the bad actors out there. Set up Fail2ban to catch them and Nginx to show them the door (with a polite "you're banned" page). The install scripts handle all the config automatically.

**Ikigai Resume App**
The resume improvement tool got some love:
- Better script compatibility
- Automatic backups
- Added HTML visualization of the Ikigai concept

**Quality of Life Updates**
- Logout actually works now (imagine that!)
- Homepage got a style refresh
- Updated user management scripts

All the changes are live and working smoothly. The drag-and-drop Kanban is particularly satisfying to use - give it a try if you haven't already!
