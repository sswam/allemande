# Devlog: Week of 2023-05-22 to 2023-05-28

What a productive week! Made major improvements to Ally Chat and launched two exciting new tools - Alfred for document processing and a suite of handy utilities.

**Ally Chat Gets Even Better**
- New black theme and CSS improvements make everything look slick
- Better handling of usernames and welcome messages
- Full support for Claude and Claude Instant models
- Added proper authentication and security
- Line breaks and thumbnails work properly now
- Fullscreen support for when you need MORE CHAT

**Meet Alfred, Your New Document Butler**
Built a sweet new doc processing system that:
- Handles text, images, audio, video like a champ
- Has a clean web UI anyone can use
- Runs on its own subdomain (alfred.allemande.ai)
- Takes a directory of files and processes them based on a mission.txt
- Zips up the results all nice and tidy

**New Utility Scripts That Actually Help**
- `bestov`: Auto-generates "best of" albums by querying AI and grabbing tracks
- `arcs`: Smart git tools for pushing/pulling between specific peers
- `giles`: Searches the web and generates summaries using Alfred
- Plus some handy command output managers and file numberers

**Other Cool Stuff**
- Universal Speech-to-Text (press F2 and talk!)
- Press F3 to simulate typing (neat trick)
- Better file sharing with updated SSHFS
- Started banning bad IPs with Fail2ban
- Fresh favicons and styling make everything prettier

The platform's really coming together - it's fun seeing all these pieces work in harmony. More improvements coming soon!
