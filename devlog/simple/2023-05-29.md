# Devlog: Late Spring Updates to Ally Chat

Made great progress expanding Ally Chat and its ecosystem of tools this week. Added some fun new AI personalities including Bilda (for build automation) and Barbie. The chat system now handles commands more elegantly using `shlex` parsing.

## New Command Line Goodies
Built several handy utilities:
- Quick file search that skips the massive folders
- Voice control for AI interactions through the improved Helposaurus
- Tools to hide/unhide files when you need them out of sight
- Better searching through PATH directories
- Slug generator for clean URLs and filenames
- HTML title extractor

## Document Processing Upgrades
Alfred and Giles (our document processing duo) got some nice improvements:
- Parallel processing in Alfred for faster throughput
- Giles can now grab content from Facebook/Instagram using Selenium
- Better topic handling in the web interface
- Support for running multiple missions

## WordPress Integration
Made it way smoother to get content from Markdown into WordPress:
- Clean conversion of Markdown sections
- Full CRUD operations for posts/pages
- Handles regular and 2K images like a champ
- Smarter automated posting with better tag handling

## Under the Hood
- Fixed up UTF-8 handling in the LLM tool
- Added exponential backoff for remote AI calls
- Reorganized dependencies and cleaned up code
- Improved error handling for Claude's long prompts
- Moved some modules around for better organization

Also refreshed the website look with new favicons and styling, and introduced some new pricing plans including a free tier. The whole system is coming together nicely!

Looking forward to building more cool features next week. If you want to try it out, the free plan is available now.
