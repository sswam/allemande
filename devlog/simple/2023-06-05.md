# Devlog: Making Ally Chat Even Better

**Supercharged the AI tools this week** with smarter model selection and better output options. Now you can pick the right AI brain for different tasks, and get your results in HTML, PDF, or Word format. It's like having a team of specialists at your fingertips.

**Git commits got an AI upgrade.** The robots are now better at writing commit messages (and yes, there are more ðŸ¤– models to choose from). Also added a cleanup option because even AIs need to tidy up sometimes.

**Made audio processing smoother** with a new silence-remover script. Perfect for cleaning up audio before speech recognition. Fixed some bugs in the whisper scripts too.

**Giles and Alfred (our document processing duo) learned new tricks:**
- Better web content fetching
- Smarter handling of tourism and industry data
- New tool for pulling out Markdown headings
- Fixed that annoying empty input bug in Alfred

**WordPress automation got a boost.** The publishing process is smoother now, handling media uploads better and making sure content gets where it needs to go.

**Added some handy developer tools:**
- Quick search shortcuts for Google and YouTube
- Force pull for Git (when you really mean it)
- Screen fixes for WSL users
- Better error handling in the LLM tools

**The whole system got tidier** with updated dependencies, better environment variables, and cleaner script organization. Because even a magical AI-powered system needs good housekeeping.

Technical highlight: The LLM model management now uses dedicated variables (`LLM_MODEL_SUMMARY`, `LLM_MODEL_SUMMARY_MEGA`, `LLM_MODEL_BRAINY`) to better match models to tasks. It's like having the right tool for every job.
