# Devlog: Making Content Creation Smarter - June 2023

This week I turbocharged our content pipeline with better automation and smarter tools. The goal: create high-quality content at scale while keeping things organized and efficient.

## Content Generation Gets an Upgrade

Built out specialized scripts for different content types:
- Industry pages now auto-generate in their own folders with proper templates
- Tourism content creation is streamlined and organized
- New book content generator that knows how to handle literary content
- All scripts now use neat dot-point summaries

The Giles web scraping tool is turning into a real workhorse - it gathers info automatically and structures it just how we need it.

## WordPress Publishing: Smooth Like Butter

Made the WordPress side of things way more elegant:
- Content uploads now run in parallel (hello speed boost!)
- Smart handling of files and directory names
- New templates for different content types
- Auto-backups of draft posts (because nobody likes losing work)

## YouTube Magic

Created a clever system that automatically picks the right YouTube categories based on video content and location. It's smart enough to skip videos that don't quite fit what we're describing.

## New Tools in the Box

Added some fun new utilities:
- `vnice`: Control process priority on the fly
- `focal-crop.py`: Smart image cropping that knows where the good stuff is
- Various setup guides for different systems

## Under the Hood

Did some maintenance work too:
- Better error handling in our LLM code
- Cleaned up search functionality
- Updated dependencies to latest versions
- Fixed some annoying bugs in audio processing

The system's getting smarter and faster every week. Next up: even more automation and some exciting new features!
