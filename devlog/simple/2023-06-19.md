# Devlog: Week of 2023-06-19

Made some nice improvements to Alfred and friends this week. Let me tell you about the cool stuff we built.

**Alfred's Web UI got smarter**
Finally added proper input validation (no more blank topics breaking things!) and made the URL downloading actually reliable. The temporary file handling is much cleaner now too. Alfred creates proper .url files and fixes extensions automatically.

**Content generation that doesn't suck**
Streamlined how Alfred handles topics and missions. Now it creates a clean topic.txt file and the pandoc commands won't choke on weird input. The whole pipeline just flows better.

**Giles learned some new tricks**
Fixed that annoying media ID bug in the industry automation script. Been playing with image IDs too - some interesting possibilities there.

**Fresh tools in the box**
- net-watch: Keeps an eye on your network and runs jobs when it's up/down
- code-style: Enforces consistent style across our scripts (with argh and logging)
- markdown-table-to-tsv: Does exactly what it says on the tin
- Some nifty image manipulation tools for zooming and converting

**Chat system leveled up**
You can now choose between local and remote models - run the heavy stuff on your beefy home PC and the light stuff on a server. Fixed that weird infinite chat loop bug too. And updated the adult content filter (goodbye Pr0nto, we hardly knew ye).

**Code cleanup**
Refactored ally_mount to be less repetitive and more readable. Updated the Makefile while I was at it. Everything's more consistent now.

**Bonus content**
Added some docs about freelancing and money-making ideas. Also threw in a fun haiku generator because why not?

The whole system's getting more robust and user-friendly with each update. Can't wait to see what we build next week!
