# Devlog: Building Better Content Tools

This week was all about supercharging our content generation and WordPress tools. The improvements make everything work smoother and produce better quality content.

## Giles Gets Smarter
Made our web scraping tool Giles much better at finding and summarizing content about industries and tourism:
- Fixed file naming patterns (now using `.txt.in`)
- Improved AI query guides for better summaries
- Fixed media handling bugs

## WordPress Integration Level Up
The WordPress tools got some nice upgrades:
- More flexible post management (create/update/find posts)
- Better tourism content templates
- Smarter media file handling

## Documentation That Actually Helps
Updated setup guides for both Windows and Debian:
- Clear Windows Terminal installation steps
- Proper WSL2 setup instructions
- Fixed Debian package lists and commands

## Cool New Tools
Added some handy utilities:
- Auto-numbering script for Markdown headings
- Simplified version of Giles ("giles1") for quick searches
- Updated haiku generator with new topics

The code is getting cleaner too - we're now checking for errors first in conditionals, which makes everything more readable. Plus, captured some exciting ideas for future tools, including a DJ app and a streamlined version of Giles.

It's amazing seeing these tools evolve and get better at what they do. Each improvement makes content creation smoother and more efficient.
