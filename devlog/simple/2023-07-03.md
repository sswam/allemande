**WordPress Tourism Templates: Making Things Pretty and Practical**

Spent the week refining our WordPress tourism templates, making them look better and work smoother. Switched from a sprawling full-width design to a cleaner single-column layout that's easier on the eyes. The map now sits above the social sharing stuff, which just makes more sense.

Also solved an annoying technical friction point - created a special import file for moving template code between Windows and WSL2. It's basically a dedicated clipboard that plays nice with vimdiff for comparing changes. Sometimes the simple solutions are the best ones.

Had Tuesday off for Independence Day, which was nice. More template refinements coming next week as we keep polishing this thing up.

Key changes:
- New single-column layout
- Better map placement
- Smoother template importing between systems
- General style improvements

*Technical detail: The dedicated import file (`tourism_import.txt`) lets us safely transfer complex template content across OS boundaries without mangling the formatting or structure.*
