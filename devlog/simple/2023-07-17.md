# Devlog: Making Life Better for New Users

Made some big improvements to help new developers and users get started more easily this week. The main focus was streamlining installation on both Debian and Windows, plus adding some handy command-line tools.

## Debian Installation Gets an Upgrade
Split the old monolithic install instructions into two clean bash scripts (`debian-1.sh` and `debian-2.sh`). They handle everything from dependencies to SSH keys now, with clear prompts so you know exactly what's happening. Cleaned up some package management stuff too - the Python distutils path works properly now, and we're using consistent apt-get commands throughout.

## Windows Setup: Clearer Path Forward
Updated the Windows guide with practical details like handling Windows Defender (it can be a pain) and added recommendations for useful tools like windirstat. The Terminal setup instructions are much clearer now too.

## New Command Line Goodies
Added a bunch of helpful scripts to make life easier:
- `wich`: Find full paths for commands (like `which` but better)
- `usage`: Quick help for commands
- `cw`: See what's inside executables
- `uniqoc`: Count unique lines (like uniq -c but more flexible)
- `kut`: Keep just the columns you want from text files

## HTML Tools
New scripts for working with web content:
- `htmlsplit`: Break HTML into manageable lines
- `de`: Convert HTML entities to plain text
- `web-title`: Grab page titles easily

Also fixed up some git handling and web service management. The whole system's getting smoother with each update!

## Small But Important Fixes
- Better .gitignore rules for hidden files
- Fixed path handling in git commit scripts
- Switched to `service` commands instead of systemctl for web services

The goal is to make everything work smoothly without getting in your way. More improvements coming soon!
