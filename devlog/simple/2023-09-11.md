# Devlog: Mid-September 2023

**Back in action with new ideas after 7 weeks away...**
Got right back into it with two interesting developments: sketching out an AI interview assistant called 'Lex', and making our file search tool even snappier.

**'Lex' - An AI that knows how to have a great conversation**
Started mapping out a fascinating new project - an AI assistant that can conduct meaningful interviews. Think of it as a smart conversation partner that could help capture life stories from elders, facilitate meetings, or guide personal development sessions.

The cool bits:
- Works solo or helps a human interviewer
- Keeps track of conversation goals and adjusts on the fly
- Voice chat with speaker recognition
- Remembers context from previous chats
- Could potentially create audiobooks using the interviewee's own voice style

I've got more wild ideas brewing, like having the AI learn to match someone's speaking style. All the initial thoughts are in `apps/lex/idea.txt` if you're curious.

**Made find-quick even quicker**
Our handy file-finding tool got a small but useful upgrade - it now skips over 'venv' directories when searching. No more wading through virtual environment files when you're looking for your actual code. Sometimes the simple fixes are the best ones.
