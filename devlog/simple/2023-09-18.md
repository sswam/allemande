# Devlog: Ally Chat Updates and AI Integration

**Major updates to Ally Chat this week, especially around AI integration.** The big one was updating our Claude integration for the new Anthropic API and Claude 2 support. Pretty sweet - we're now running with a 100k token limit, though I still need to verify this works right with claude-1.

**Added "missions" to give AI agents more context.** The system now loads special .m files alongside chat files to provide extra guidance to the AI. It's a bit hacky right now - sometimes the context gets mangled - but it's working well enough for testing.

**Brainstormed some fun new AI applications:**
- Legal document generator that actually understands what you need
- Interactive fiction where you and the AI write stories together
- Personalized nutrition planner based on your specific situation
- Legal argument generator that digs through case histories

**Started designing a slick new chat UI.** Details are in the framework doc if you're curious. Also made some quality-of-life improvements like better markdown support in the vim integration.

**Technical bits for the curious:**
- Updated claude.py for the latest API
- Added logging config to quiet down httpx
- Mission files use .m extension and pre-process chat context
- New markdown syntax settings in chat.vim

Working on cleaning up the partial message issues in mission processing. For now there's a temporary fix in place while I figure out the cleanest way to handle it.

Nothing too earth-shattering this week, but steady progress making Ally Chat more capable and fun to use. Let me know if you want to dig into any of the technical details!
