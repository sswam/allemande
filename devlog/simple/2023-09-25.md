# Devlog: Week of 2023-09-25 to 2023-10-01

Made some nice improvements to Ally Chat this week, especially around summarization. Also played with some fun new ideas and fixed up our web tools.

**Better Chat Summaries**
Built a sweet two-stage summarization system that uses Claude Instant for quick first drafts, then lets the full Claude model organize everything by topic. It's like having a really smart secretary who takes great notes. Still tweaking it, but it's already pretty slick.

**New Project Ideas**
- Email integration: Let AI agents handle email like personal assistants. Could expand to other chat services too.
- Health monitor app: Keep an eye on vital signs during sleep, alert someone if things go sideways. Could literally save lives.

**Web Tools Upgrade**
Made our web content processing a lot smarter:
- Better HTML cleaning before Markdown conversion
- New testing script to compare different AI models for summarization
- Fixed up the URL handling and link formatting
- Made the web content fetching more reliable

The HTML cleaner is especially good with Wikipedia pages now - strips out all the navigation crud and leaves just the good stuff.

**Bug Squashing**
Fixed a duplicate script call in pandoc-dump and cleaned up some regex patterns. Also documented a funny GPT-4 typo for posterity.

Everything's working smoother now, and we've got some exciting new features in the pipeline. Pretty productive week!
