**Streamlining Web Content Processing & Playing with LLM Training Ideas**

Had a productive two weeks off tinkering with Ally Chat's web handling. Made some neat improvements to how it processes online content, and explored an interesting idea about LLM training.

**Cool Idea: Less is More for LLMs?**
What if we stopped forcing LLMs to memorize everything under the sun? Added some thoughts about providing knowledge as input instead - might free up those neural networks for better reasoning. It's like the difference between memorizing a textbook versus learning how to use a reference library.

**Pandoc Tools Got an Upgrade**
Enhanced our HTML-to-Markdown conversion tools:
- Added metadata control (show/hide titles and URLs)
- Better content extraction from HTML
- Smarter cleanup of Wikipedia articles
- Main content now properly extracted from `<main>` and `<article>` tags

**Web Summary Testing Enhanced**
Updated our web page analysis script to work with both Claude and ChatGPT tokenization. Now tracking token counts properly and storing URLs for easy reference. Because sometimes you need to know exactly how chatty your AI is being.

**Quick Bug Squash**
Found a wonky line in `pandoc-dump-clean` trying to filter image URLs. Commented it out for now - better to have it do nothing than do the wrong thing. Will fix properly once we figure out what it was supposed to do in the first place.

The tools are getting sharper, the content processing cleaner, and the ideas keep flowing. Looking forward to seeing how these improvements shape up in practice.
