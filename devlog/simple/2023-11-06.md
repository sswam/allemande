# Devlog: Week of 2023-11-06 to 2023-11-12

**Ally Chat gets GPT-4 Turbo and better error handling**
Added the shiny new GPT-4 Turbo model to Ally Chat, along with model ID override options. The original GPT-4 is still there as "gpt-4-orig" if you want it. Also snuck in Claude-2 for future shenanigans.

**Making async functions more stubborn**
Built a new `aretry` function that lets async operations try again when they fail. It's like telling your code "if at first you don't succeed, try try again" - but with configurable retry counts and sleep times. When it hits a truly unfixable error, it throws up its hands and lets you know.

**Web content cleanup gets less messy**
Fixed some annoying bugs in the Pandoc cleanup scripts. One regex was misbehaving with `data:image` URLs, and the HTML content extraction needed better pattern matching. Now it handles `<main>` and `<article>` tags more gracefully.

**New subdomain for flipit.allemande.ai**
Added routing for a new subdomain through HAProxy to nginx. Simple but necessary infrastructure work to keep everything running smoothly.

Just a productive fortnight with some nice quality-of-life improvements to the platform. The async retry function should make things more reliable, and having GPT-4 Turbo in the mix opens up some interesting possibilities.
