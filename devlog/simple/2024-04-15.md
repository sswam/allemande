# Devlog: Week of 2024-04-15 to 2024-04-21

After a few months break, I got back to adding some sweet new features to make life easier. Added some handy scripts, made the AI chat smarter, and fixed up the proxy and window management setup.

## New Scripts That Actually Help
Built two utilities that I've been wanting forever:
- `json2csv.py`: Converts JSON arrays to CSV. Feed it JSON, get CSV. Simple.
- `wikitext-get.sh`: Grabs Wikipedia content in raw wikitext format. Great for data mining.

## Making GPT-4 Less Forgetful
Doubled the chat context from 10 to 20 lines. Now GPT-4 can keep track of more conversation history before getting amnesia. Costs a bit more but worth it for better chat flow.

## HAProxy Getting Busier
Added routing for new subdomains: `flipit_dev.allemande.ai` and `chatpal.allemande.ai`. Nothing fancy, just standard proxy config to keep the traffic flowing where it should.

## i3 Window Management Cleanup
Fixed some annoying workspace naming issues in i3. Renamed "brain-local" to just "brain" and squashed a Makefile bug that was messing with the layout. Now my windows actually go where they're supposed to.

This is the kind of infrastructure work that nobody notices until it breaks, but it keeps everything running smoothly. More improvements coming soon!
