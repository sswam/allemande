# Devlog: New GPT-4o Integration

Added OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model to Ally Chat this week. Pretty straightforward update but exciting stuff!

The integration required adding the model ID and description to `llm.py`, updating the model selection logic, and setting up proper logging. For now, we're using the same cost parameters as regular GPT-4, though that might change once we see real usage patterns.

This update means Ally Chat users can now access OpenAI's most advanced model directly in their conversations. Neat! Can't wait to see what kind of conversations and creations people come up with using this new capability.

That's the whole update - short and sweet. Sometimes the most important changes don't need a lot of complexity. Just drop in the new model and let the magic happen. âœ¨

Technical bits:
- Added model to llm.py
- Updated selection logic
- Implemented logging
- Maintained cost parity with GPT-4 (for now)
