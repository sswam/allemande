# Devlog: Week of 2024-06-17

Back from a little break and diving into some crucial Ally Chat updates! The OpenAI API changed while I was away, so I had to update our code to keep everything running smoothly. Here's what's new:

**OpenAI API Updates**
Modernized our API integration in `llm.py` to work with OpenAI's latest changes. Switched from the old `ChatCompletion.create` to their new client system. Now Ally Chat can keep chatting with all the latest OpenAI bells and whistles.

**Better Error Handling**
Added a fancy new retry system for when things go sideways with API calls. The new `aretry.py` module lets us gracefully handle temporary hiccups by retrying failed operations. Since Ally Chat juggles multiple AI models from different vendors, this makes everything more reliable.

**Quick Fix**
Fixed a silly typo in `llm.py` where `-x` was used instead of `-p` for line-by-line processing. Small fix, but it keeps things tidy!

I know three weeks is a long time between updates, but sometimes you need a break to come back stronger. These changes might not look huge, but they keep Ally Chat running smoothly and ready for whatever new AI goodness comes next.
