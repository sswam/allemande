# New Mini Model and Updates in Ally Chat

Added a speedy new budget AI model and refreshed our Claude lineup this week. After a few weeks off, it felt great to get back to improving Ally Chat.

## The New Mini Model

Integrated `gpt-4o-mini` (we call it "4m") as a fast, cheap option for simpler tasks. At $0.002 per use, it's perfect for quick queries and basic assistance. Think of it as the nimble sports car in our fleet of AI models - not as powerful as its bigger siblings, but way more efficient for zipping around town.

## Claude Gets a Makeover

Updated our Claude models to version 3:
- `claude-2` → just `claude` now (ID: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
- `claude-instant-v1` → `claude-haiku` (ID: claude-3-haiku-20240307)

These changes keep us current with the latest AI tech while maintaining the smooth experience users expect from Ally Chat. More improvements coming soon!
