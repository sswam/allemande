# Devlog: LLM Tools and Script Improvements

**Made our LLM tools way more useful this week.** Added some neat scripts to see what the AI's been saying (`llm-last`), plus better ways to ask it questions (`llm/que`) and get it to process stuff (`llm/proc`). They're like the command-line equivalent of "Hey AI, keep it snappy and skip the fluff."

**Logging's less of a mess now.** Split up the AI conversation logs into separate files for what we ask and what it answers. Makes it way easier to figure out why it's being weird when it is.

**New subtitle grabber script.** Built a tool to yank subtitles out of videos using ffmpeg. It can clean them up too, getting rid of all that timestamp crud if you want just the text.

**Sync scripts got smarter.** Made the Allemande sync play nice with Barbarella's GitHub repo too. Now it pulls everything before pushing anything - way less likely to break stuff.

**Better commit messages.** Fixed `llm-git-commit` so it doesn't try to stuff code blocks into commit messages anymore. Because nobody needs their git log looking like a markdown tutorial.

The really cool part is how all these little improvements work together. The LLM tools especially are making it super smooth to work with AI from the command line. It's like having a really smart assistant who knows how to shut up and get to the point.
