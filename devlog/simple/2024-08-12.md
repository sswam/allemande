# Devlog: Hugging Face Downloads Now Working!

Finally squashed that pesky authorization bug with our Hugging Face integration! The fix was surprisingly simple - our `wget` command just needed the right authentication headers. Now we can properly download from gated repositories using the `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`.

It's a small change but makes a huge difference for developers working with private or gated models. Just add the Bearer token in the authorization header and you're good to go!

Sometimes the simplest fixes bring the most satisfaction. Looking forward to seeing what cool models you all download and experiment with now that this is working smoothly.

Back to full development next week - this was just a quick fix during some time off. But hey, even small wins count! ðŸŽ‰
