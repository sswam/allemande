# Devlog: Week of 2024-08-19 to 2024-08-25

Made some cool improvements to our AI tools this week. Added better code generation, smarter text processing, and image handling from Civitai. The commit message system got an upgrade too.

## New Code Tools
Wrote `reverse_lines.py` and `word_frequency.py` with proper unit tests. These aren't just examples - they're actually useful tools that show the AI how to write good Python code. The tests make sure everything works exactly as it should.

## Markdown Magic
Built a sweet CLI tool that pulls code blocks out of Markdown files. It can even comment out the non-code parts if you want. Also made a table formatter that makes your Markdown tables look pretty instead of like they were formatted by a drunk raccoon.

## Image Integration
Added `civitai_images.py` to grab image URLs from their API. You can filter by model ID, username, or NSFW content. It handles pagination too, so you can fetch tons of images without breaking a sweat.

## Smarter Commit Messages
Updated the LLM commit message system to be clearer and more focused. Now it knows exactly what commit types to use (feat, fix, docs, etc.) and how to format everything properly. The process command got better guidance too, so the AI won't go off the rails.

## Quick Fixes
- Fixed code indentation in `llm.py` - no more surprise tabs
- Made `markdown_code.py` play nice with stdin
- Added `wgall` for parallel processing
- Improved the example scripts and tests
- Updated `search.py` with better engine handling and table headers

This is all part of making our AI tools smarter and more useful. Every improvement makes the system better at helping humans do cool stuff.
