# Devlog: Week of 2024-08-26 to 2024-09-01

Built some cool stuff this week! Got our email tools working nicely, made the LLMs write better commit messages, and upgraded to Claude 3. Plus, I got older and wiser on Saturday. ðŸŽ‚

## Email Magic
Created a suite of Python tools to handle emails like a boss:
- Fetches from IMAP servers
- Strips out the garbage (links, images, weird headers)
- Generates summaries using LLMs
- Actually handles character encodings properly (finally!)

All the scripts live in a dedicated `email/` directory now, because organization matters.

## Smarter Commit Messages
Enhanced `llm-git-commit` to check for bugs before writing commit messages. The LLM now reviews the patch first, then writes a proper message following Conventional Commits. No more "updated stuff" commits!

## Claude 3 Integration
Updated everything to use the latest Claude 3 API. New models, better token handling, modern message format. It's faster and smarter now.

## Environment Cleanup
Added `ALLEMANDE_LLM_DEFAULT` and `ALLEMANDE_LLM_DEFAULT_CHEAP` environment variables so we can easily switch between different LLMs. No more hardcoded model names scattered everywhere.

## Web UI Modernization
Fixed up the Alfred and Flash apps to use current Gradio components. Replaced all the deprecated stuff with modern equivalents.

## Time Tools
Added some handy scripts for time calculations:
- `add_durations.py`: Adds up HH:MM times
- `subtract_time.py`: Finds time differences
- `subtract_time.sh`: Same thing but for shell scripts

Nice little utilities that make life easier.

All in all, a productive week with some solid improvements to our tooling. The email handling stuff is particularly satisfying - it's amazing how much cleaner everything is now.
