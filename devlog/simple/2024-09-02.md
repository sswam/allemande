# Devlog: Email Tools & LLM Improvements

**Email handling got some nice upgrades this week.** The tools now create missing directories automatically, ask for confirmation before important steps, and handle folder listing more elegantly. The IMAP script is smarter about different server capabilities and gives better feedback when things go wrong.

**The commit message AI got better at catching problems.** Added a sanity check before bug reviews and made the prompts clearer about what we want. Also fixed an annoying ^C bug that was driving me nuts.

**Time tracking scripts are now less fussy about 24+ hours.** Switched from datetime objects to simple integer math. Now you can track marathon coding sessions without the scripts complaining about impossible times.

Technical bits:
- XLIST command support with LIST fallback for IMAP folders
- Token counting before summarization to avoid surprises
- Better error logging with exception types
- Environment variables for user customization
- Integer-based time calculations instead of datetime objects

The email tools are really coming together nicely. I'm particularly happy with how the folder listing works now - it's much more useful for real-world email setups. Next week I'll probably add some more convenience features, but the core functionality is solid.
