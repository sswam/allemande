# Devlog: Building Cool Stuff with AI and Media Tools

Made some serious progress this week on our code generation and media processing tools. The AI integration is getting smarter, and the codebase is looking cleaner.

## Code Generation Gets an Upgrade
Added some nifty tools to make coding faster and cleaner:
- Quick Python program generator that starts from "hello world"
- AI-powered code refactoring tool that can transform code based on prompts
- Style matcher that helps code look consistent
- Language detector for files
- Documentation generator that doesn't suck

## Making Media Processing Less Painful
Built a suite of subtitle tools because, let's face it, subtitle work is usually a mess:
- Line buffer with configurable delays
- Script cleanup for those nasty scanned files
- MPV subtitle saver
- Script synchronization tool
- Added a cool script for watching movies with AI assistance

## AI Gets Smarter
The LLM integration got some love:
- Added model aliases so you're not stuck with one AI
- Better commit messages that actually make sense
- Configurable diff context for git commits
- Started work on flexible token stopping (still in progress)

## Cleaning House
Moved stuff where it belongs:
- Code tools got their own directory
- Geo tools found a home
- Utilities stopped cluttering the main directory

## Markup Tools Because Why Not
Added some handy markup processing tools:
- Tag indenter and validator
- Markup splitter that respects tag boundaries
- Made sure it's all easy to access in PATH

Everything's working smoother now, and the AI integration is starting to feel pretty slick. Still more to do, but it's coming together nicely.
