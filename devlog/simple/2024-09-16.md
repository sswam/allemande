# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-16 to 2024-09-22

Made lots of cool improvements to my toolkit this week! Added better testing, smarter AI tools, and some fun utilities. Here's what's new:

## Bash Scripts Got Better
- Enhanced `opts` for cleaner option parsing
- Made `hello.sh` more intelligent with AI greetings
- Added proper BATS tests because untested code is scary
- Now everything follows consistent style guidelines

## AI Tools Growing Up
- New quick-hit scripts `1sp` and `1wp` for when you just need a quick answer
- `comment.sh` adds smart comments to your code
- Fixed some annoying model selection bugs
- Made everything play nicer together through `ally.sh`
- `todos.sh` now handles TODO/FIXME/XXX without destroying your comments

## New Tools in the Box
- `find-todos` hunts down those "I'll fix it later" comments
- `ignore.sh` makes .gitignore management less painful
- `indenter.py` figures out your code style and matches it
- `code-language.py` tells you what language you're looking at
- `pomodoro.sh` keeps you focused (or tries to)
- `waywo.sh` bugs you about what you're doing (in a good way)
- `TextCorrector` fixes mangled text without the headache

## File Management Made Easier
- Better rubbish bin scripts so you don't accidentally nuke important stuff
- `canon` creates smart symlinks
- `modify` applies commands but keeps backups

## Text Processing Power
- `markdown_number.py` handles heading/list numbering
- `pdfocr.sh` turns PDFs into searchable text
- Added some Perl magic for text substitution

## Behind the Scenes
- Created a proper Perl module for logging
- Updated environment setup and dependencies
- Added example code for reference
- Wrote some actual planning docs (shocking, I know)

The toolkit's getting pretty robust now. Each piece does one thing well and plays nice with the others. Everything's tested, documented, and follows consistent patterns. And most importantly, it's actually useful for real work!
