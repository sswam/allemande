# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-23

What a fantastic week of coding! The project grew in several exciting directions, with major improvements to our AI tools, image processing, and core libraries.

## Major Updates

**Ally Library Gets Superpowers**
The ally library got a serious upgrade with lazy loading - modules now load only when needed, making everything snappier. Added some slick new I/O handling and dynamic variable referencing. Also moved some stuff around to make more sense, like putting terminal code where it belongs.

**Bash Scripts That Actually Help**
Added some handy one-liner scripts for quick AI tasks (`1sp` for single sentences, `1wp` for single words). The opts system got smarter about help text, and we ditched some unnecessary strictness that was just getting in the way.

**AI Integration That Just Works**
New tools for merging similar inputs using AI, better prompts for catching errors, and support for Perplexity and Google AI models. Added timing options so you can see how fast (or slow) things are. The translation script is particularly cool - it converts between formats while preserving the important bits.

**Image Processing for Humans**
Got Stable Diffusion WebUI working smoothly through the API. Added tools for debugging images and handling metadata properly. The image viewer got smarter - you can now move images to output folders with a keystroke. SDXL support is in there too.

**Useful New Tools**
- Time interval descriptions that make sense
- Text processing tools that don't suck
- Code language detection that actually works
- File swapping that preserves hard links
- Web page summarization that's actually helpful

## What's Next?

The project's getting better every week. Planning to make the LLM tools even smoother and experiment more with that lazy loading system - it's showing a lot of promise for keeping things fast and clean.

I'm particularly stoked about how the dynamic loading is working out. It's making everything more efficient without adding complexity for users. That's exactly what we're aiming for.

## Code Samples

```python
# Before: Eager loading everything
import huge_module
huge_module.do_something()

# After: Lazy loading ftw
from ally.lazy import LazyProxy
huge_module = LazyProxy('huge_module')
huge_module.do_something()  # Only loads when needed
```

This is the kind of improvement that makes coding fun - simple changes with big impacts.
