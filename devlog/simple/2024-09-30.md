# Devlog: Week of 2024-09-30

This week was amazingly productive! The project got massive upgrades across the board, especially in AI capabilities and file management. Let me share the exciting developments.

## AI Gets Smarter & Faster
- Made chat functions async - way faster now
- Added support for newest LLM models
- Built a sweet AI-powered interview tool
- Created an AI project manager that actually works
- Added translation between file formats using AI

## File Management That Doesn't Suck
- New "canon" directory keeps everything organized
- Symlinks point to canonical versions - no more confusion
- Better tools for joining, splitting, and cleaning files
- Can detect and remove junk files automatically
- Smart file updates that only change what needs changing

## Web UI Leveling Up
- Added PWA support - use it like a native app
- Lazy loading makes everything faster
- Multi-column layouts that actually look good
- Built a web content summarizer
- Auto-generates favicons (because who wants to do that manually?)

## Testing & Code Quality
- More BATS tests (with optional AI testing)
- Consistent snake_case naming (goodbye CamelCase)
- Better Bash option handling
- New code language detector

## Cool New Tools
- Multi-way diff tool (still in testing)
- Code swapper for quick refactoring
- Audiobook summarization pipeline
- Universal file converter (A2B)

## Challenges
Still wrestling with Stable Diffusion setup - those image generation tools are tricky beasts.

## Next Up
- Making the LLM tools even smoother
- Building out the PortClient class
- More work on ally.sh - it's becoming something special

The project is really coming together. Every new feature makes me more excited about where this is heading!
