# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-07

Made huge progress this week! The Ally framework is really coming together, and we've added a ton of AI-powered goodies. Let me tell you about the cool stuff:

## AI Tools That Actually Work
- New code improvement scripts that don't suck (`improve.sh`, `messy.sh`)
- Fun text tools like `praise.sh` and `roast.sh` for when you need AI snark
- Smart summarization that actually gets to the point
- API docs that write themselves (mostly correctly!)

## Making File Management Suck Less
- Finally dealing with those pesky rubbish files properly
- Better file finding with `wich` and friends
- `curate.sh` for when your directories are a mess
- Experimental multi-way diff (it's alive, but handle with care)

## Web UI Getting Fancy
- Progressive Web App support (yes, it works offline!)
- Lazy loading so things don't crawl
- Voice chat experiments (early days, don't get too excited)
- Pricing page that doesn't look like it's from 1995

## The Really Good Stuff
- Everything's moving to `ally.sh` for command handling
- Parallel processing for rich text (because waiting is for chumps)
- Better dependency tracking that actually knows where things are
- Style module to make code look pretty (Python and bash for now)

## Coming Soon
- More Portal framework goodness
- Better tests (because we're not savages)
- Streamlined LLM tools that don't require a PhD to use

The `ally.sh` framework is turning out to be a game-changer. Sure, moving everything over is a pain, but it's worth it. And don't get me started on how excited I am about the Portals framework - this is going to be good.
