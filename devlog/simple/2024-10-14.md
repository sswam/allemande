# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-14 to 2024-10-20

Made great progress integrating everything into the `ally` framework this week, while adding some cool new AI features. The codebase is getting cleaner and more consistent, which makes me happy.

## Major Updates

**Ally Framework Getting Stronger**
- Cleaned up input/output with new `geput` module - no more newline drama!
- Better logging with improved context decorator
- Moving everything to `ally` for option parsing - bye bye `argh`
- Updated core scripts like `hello_py.py` to use the new framework

**New AI Tools**
- Added a work-in-progress refactoring tool to help convert code to the `ally` framework
- Built a text completion tool using local LLMs with streaming output
- Created a fun "Chinese Whispers" translation game
- Made the summary tool more concise - one line, no fluff
- Improved the chatbot brain with better option handling

**Web Chat Updates**
- Organized all the icons and images into a central `pix` directory
- Cleaned up asset management with symlinks

**File Management**
- Better junk file handling - now with a "remove" option
- Consolidated find scripts and made them more accessible
- Added tools for Git workflow and TSV processing
- Built a coroutine-based file merger

## What's Next

- Keep working on the refactoring tool to automate framework conversion
- Make the IO system more testable
- Develop the PortClient class
- Add more unit tests around the CLI framework
- Build infrastructure for deeper AI integration

The project is really coming together. The new AI tools are making development faster and more fun, and the unified framework makes everything cleaner. Can't wait to add more features next week!
