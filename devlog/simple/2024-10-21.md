# Devlog: Week of 2024-10-21 to 2024-10-27

Making Ally Chat more awesome this week! Major upgrades to our C and shell scripts, plus some shiny new AI toys to play with. Fixed up a bunch of code and got our test game stronger.

## The Good Stuff:

**Made Old Code Sparkle Again**
- Modernized C and shell scripts with the `ally` library for clean argument parsing
- Split up some monolithic functions into neat, focused pieces
- Added proper tests because we're not savages

**AI Powers Activated**
- Added image and video generation (think DALL-E but cooler)
- Built age estimation tools using various AI models
- Enhanced code review capabilities - now the AI can tell you why your code makes baby pandas cry

**Speech Processing**
- Got speaker diarization working properly (finally!)
- Added infrastructure for age estimation from voice

## The Details That Matter

### Script Modernization
The `ally` library is our new best friend for handling command-line options. Updated a bunch of tools including `hello_c`, `glxgears`, and various shell scripts. Made everything play nice together with consistent option handling.

### New AI Features
Packed in some seriously cool stuff:
- Text-to-image/video generation right from the chat interface
- Age estimation tools using multiple AI models
- Smart code review that actually gives useful feedback

### Testing & Infrastructure
- Added proper test infrastructure for the C code
- Built in test timeouts because infinite loops are nobody's friend
- Improved error handling and logging across the board

### Challenges
Still wrestling with some legacy code modernization and making sure the AI tools are doing what they claim. But hey, that's part of the fun, right?

Who knew making chat apps could be this entertaining? More cool stuff coming soon!
