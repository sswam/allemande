# Devlog: A Week of Building Cool Stuff

This week I expanded Ally Chat with image classification, model downloads, and better browser automation. Also improved our shell scripts and started designing the AMPS language. Here's what's new:

## Image Classification with FastAI
Got image classification working smoothly using FastAI - both single images and batches. The system can now learn from new datasets and get better at specific types of images. Fixed some annoying command-line flag issues in the illustration code too.

## Downloading AI Models Made Easy
Built a sweet tool for grabbing models from CivitAI. Just give it a model ID or URL and your API key, and it handles the rest. You can grab specific versions or the whole set.

## Browser Automation Leveled Up
Made our Selenium integration way more capable:
- Browser sessions now remember cookies
- Can scroll to specific page elements
- Added manual browser control option
- Better SVG handling
And renamed some stuff to be clearer.

## AMPS Language Taking Shape
Started documenting the core design of AMPS - our new language focusing on relations and bidirectional evaluation. Planning a careful rollout to get it right.

## Better Shell Tools
Added a bunch of useful bash utilities:
- "quiet-" tools for controlling output
- Argument checking
- Function calling by name
- Test helpers for watching commands and handling files
- Code formatting and linting tools

## Polish and Setup
- Improved git commit messages
- Better Windows setup guide
- Updated Debian install scripts with editor choice and SSH key handling
- Added style guides for Perl and bash

## What's Next?
Working on making the AI tools more robust and converting some legacy code. But overall, really happy with how things are coming together!
