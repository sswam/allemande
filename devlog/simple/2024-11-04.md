# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-04

What a productive week! Added YOLO object detection to Ally Chat, making it smarter about analyzing images. Also beefed up our Civitai integration and made a bunch of quality-of-life improvements to our tooling.

## The Exciting Stuff

**YOLO Vision**
- Added object detection that spits out bounding boxes
- Can output center coordinates or full boxes
- Optional visual display window for debugging

**Better Civitai Integration**
- Smoother model downloads with better version info
- Cursor-based pagination that actually works
- Cleaner naming to avoid conflicts

**Environment & Tools**
- Smarter environment variable handling
- New weight converter (lbs <-> kg)
- Cleaner logging system
- Better CLI argument parsing

**Fun with AMPS**
Added demo files for the AMPS module in C, Python, and Shell - developed these while chatting with Gemini Flash. They show off some cool ways to use AMPS across different languages.

## Under the Hood

**Bash Improvements**
- Fixed formy/linty/testy to handle binary files properly
- Added existence checks to prevent cryptic errors
- `tstrip` now uses Python for better newline handling

**Python Migration**
Moved more scripts to `python3-allemande` - keeps everything in its proper environment.

**HAProxy**
Simplified the config and prepped for client includes. Less complexity = more happiness.

Still dealing with some legacy code that needs updating, but who isn't? The important thing is we're making steady progress and adding cool new features along the way.
