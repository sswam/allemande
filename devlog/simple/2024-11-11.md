# Devlog: Enhanced Security and Authentication in Ally Chat

This week was all about beefing up Ally Chat's security with JWT authentication - making it both more secure and easier to use. I also cleaned up some code and improved our utility scripts.

## Major Updates

**New JWT Authentication**
- Replaced basic auth with JWT tokens across all Ally Chat domains
- Added secure cookie handling with all the proper flags
- Built user management system that creates proper Linux home directories
- Integrated with Nginx using the TeslaGov JWT module

**Better Configuration**
- Updated Nginx configs across all subdomains to use JWT auth
- Improved timeout settings (10min) in haproxy
- Added proper CORS support for cross-domain requests
- Fixed redirect handling for API endpoints

**Useful New Tools**
- Binary/hex conversion utility
- RFC 2822 header processor
- File locking tools using fcntl
- Enhanced directory detection scripts

## Technical Details

The JWT implementation stores bcrypt password hashes in .htpasswd and creates proper Linux users with /usr/sbin/nologin shells. The auth service uses FastAPI and handles login/logout across domains.

Nginx now uses ngx-http-auth-jwt-module instead of basic auth, configured with:
```nginx
auth_jwt_key "secret";
auth_jwt_loginurl "/login";
auth_jwt off; # For API endpoints
```

We're using proper cookie attributes:
```javascript
httponly: true,
secure: true,
domain: ".allemande.ai",
samesite: "strict"
```

## What's Next

Some async server bugs popped up during testing that need attention. Otherwise, the new auth system is working smoothly and provides a much better foundation for future security improvements.

The JWT implementation was tricky but worth it - much more secure than basic auth and a better user experience too. Now we can focus on adding more cool features to Ally Chat!
