# Devlog: Week of 2024-11-18 to 2024-11-24

The Allemande AI ecosystem got some major upgrades this week. Ally Chat's language models are running smoother, the interface is cleaner, and there's a bunch of new utility scripts that make life easier. I even started dabbling in game development - because why not make AI fun?

## Chat and AI Improvements
- Added support for GGUF models, so you can run lighter AI models locally
- Fixed the "chatty AIs" problem - now they take turns properly
- Better markdown layout and math rendering
- Smarter context handling and search behavior
- Disabled the NSFW stuff because... well, obviously

## New Tools and Scripts
- Built tools for handling text and TSV files (`txt2tsv`, `tsv-tidy`, etc.)
- Added proper file locking (both sync and async)
- Created some handy system admin scripts like `disk-free-human.sh`
- Made file backups go to the trash instead of cluttering `/tmp`
- Added `vimdiff_tilde.sh` for comparing files with their backups

## Game Development!
Started building a simple game engine with Pygame:
- Basic framework for handling events, drawing, sound
- Created "Move the Square!" as a test game
- Added mouse dragging and music support
- Set up some curriculum-related project scripts

## PWA and Portal Work
- Started (and temporarily shelved) work on making Ally Chat a Progressive Web App
- Cleaned up the portals code and renamed some stuff for clarity
- Improved the mount points system for better file handling

## Challenges
- Juggling multiple features without dropping the ball
- Wrestling with service worker bugs
- Some AI framework installation headaches

All in all, it's been a productive week! The ecosystem is growing, and I'm having fun building it.
