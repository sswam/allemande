# Devlog: Week in the Lab

**Ally Chat got some sweet upgrades this week!** The chat app now handles keyboard input better, welcomes new users more smoothly, and has improved AI responses from Claude. I started work on making it a Progressive Web App too, though wrestling with service workers is like trying to teach a cat to fetch.

**Speech synthesis leveled up:** Fixed some version conflicts in the Parler-TTS system and made it default to the "mini" model. Now it's faster and plays nicer with different SDK versions. The larger models are still there if you need that extra quality boost.

**Game dev continues to be fun:** Added zooming to the Sierpinski gasket viewer (because who doesn't want to zoom infinitely into fractals?) and threw in some drawing tools. Nothing says "math is fun" like being able to scribble all over your sacred geometry.

**New utility script: `awatch`** - It's like having a tiny robot assistant that runs commands whenever files change. Perfect for developers who hate manually rebuilding their code every two minutes.

**OpenAPI docs get the Marie Kondo treatment:** Built a tool that turns sprawling API documentation into clean, LLM-friendly markdown. Because even AIs deserve readable docs.

The PWA work is still ongoing - turns out service workers are particular about their CORS policies. Who knew browsers could be so picky about security? (Everyone. Everyone knew this.)

But overall, it's been a great week of building cool stuff and making things work better. The Ally Chat improvements especially make me happy - it's becoming more polished with each update.

_Technical bits for the curious:_
- Added separate tokenizers for sdk 1.1 models
- Improved AST handling for REPL-style notebook kernels
- Enhanced regex matching for LLM response processing
- Implemented file change detection with command execution hooks
