# Devlog: Making Ally Chat More Awesome

**File handling is now smooth as butter in Ally Chat**
Just rolled out proper file uploads - images, videos, audio, whatever you need. The system automatically figures out what kind of file you're sharing and displays it beautifully in markdown. Videos even get automatically converted to web-friendly formats if needed. It's like magic, but with actual code behind it.

**Admin tools got a serious upgrade**
The backend is now smarter about handling multiple clients and portals. Renamed "ports" to "portals" because, let's face it, that's what they actually are. Added proper hostname handling so different machines play nice together. The install scripts are actually helpful now, with proper help messages and everything.

**AI models are getting craftier**
Made the AI responses more natural by tweaking how they handle conversation stops and starts. The Llama model is now delightfully unpredictable (in a good way) thanks to some temperature and sampling adjustments. A1111 image generation got some love too - better checkpoint selection and more nuanced prompt weighting.

**Core improvements that make everything better**
- Ditched the external slugify package for our own sleek implementation
- Streaming code is now properly async with better resource management
- Added a proper image generation service for A1111
- Everything's more async now, because waiting is for chumps

All of this makes Ally Chat faster, more reliable, and more fun to use. The streaming code refactor was a bit of a brain-twister, but sometimes you gotta wrestle with async to make things right.

Next up: More cool features and probably some fixes for things we haven't broken yet. ðŸ˜‰
