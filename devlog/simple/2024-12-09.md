# Devlog: A Week of Cool New Stuff in Ally Chat

**Added a retro puzzle game called Rockfall!**
It's like Boulder Dash - push rocks around, collect diamonds, don't get crushed. Shows off what the platform can do beyond just chat.

**Chat got some nice quality-of-life updates:**
- "Oops" button to undo your last message
- Archive feature to save chat history
- Cleaner control panel layout
- Better video recording and YouTube embeds
- Fixed some annoying bugs with usernames and animations

**Under the hood improvements:**
Made the AI responses better by tweaking the Llama parameters - dropped some complexity and followed Claude's advice on good settings. Also cleaned up the JavaScript example code to work better across platforms.

**For the tech-minded:**
- Added a third suffix option in buflines.py for more flexible line formatting
- Disabled some demo cronjobs that weren't needed
- LLM query tools now handle multiple reference files
- Simplified file clearing to use unlink instead of truncation

The chat interface keeps getting more polished, the AI is getting smarter, and we've got games now! Every week brings something new and interesting to play with.
