# Devlog: Week of 2024-12-16 - Proactive AI, Push Notifications, and More

Just wrapped up an exciting week of adding cool new features to Ally Chat! Coming back from holiday prep, I dove into making the AI more engaging and interactive.

## Big Updates

**AI That Starts Conversations:** Added a smart system where AI agents can initiate chats at random intervals, but only when it makes sense. The AI checks if you've been chatting recently and varies its timing to feel natural. You can even have it pop open your browser when the AI wants to talk!

**Phone-Style Notifications:** Web push notifications are now working! Get pinged when there's activity in your chats. The groundwork is laid for more notification types in the future.

**Anime Art Generation:** Added a new AI model called "Poni" for generating anime-style artwork.

**Better Log Watching:** Made `atail` more robust - it now handles file changes more gracefully and can use polling instead of inotify when needed. Great for keeping an eye on server logs without missing anything.

## Other Cool Stuff

- Built a thread-safe dictionary that won't get confused when multiple things try to use it at once
- Added a text processing tool called `ted.pl` for quick stdin/stdout operations
- Cleaned up templates for new code files
- Made disk space reporting more compact and readable
- Added a disk speed testing script
- Streamlined the config file setup
- Added a way to fetch the last N messages from chat history
- Removed some old code and unused UI elements

The chat system keeps getting better! These updates make it more interactive and reliable while laying groundwork for future features.
