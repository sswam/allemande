# Devlog: Making Ally Chat Better, Week of Dec 23-29

Had a great week improving various parts of Ally Chat! The recording interface is way more intuitive now - just one button to pause/resume recording instead of separate controls cluttering things up. Plus the "cancel" button now says "back" which makes way more sense.

Fixed up how the AI agents recognize when someone's talking to them. They're better at catching their names at the start/end of messages or when followed by commas. Also killed some noisy debug logging that was spamming the chat.

Added a neat feature to the A1111 image generation client - you can now add comments in your prompts! Makes it way easier to organize and experiment with different prompt variations.

Fixed an annoying bug in `atail` (our log monitoring utility) where it would lose track of files that got removed and recreated. Now it keeps following like a champ.

Started playing with some interesting ideas around LLM self-control - imagine if they could tweak their own parameters like temperature on the fly. Could lead to some fascinating behaviors.

Other random improvements:
- Added a summary of an obscure apocryphal text (The Story of Melchizedek)
- Made the Makefile more flexible by using variables instead of hardcoded paths
- Cleaned up various bits of UI and backend code

Overall, Ally Chat is getting smoother and more capable every week. The goal is to make it not just powerful, but actually fun to use.
