# Devlog: Making AI Chat Friends Better

This week was all about making our AI chat buddies more engaging and keeping the system running smoothly. Got some nice improvements done!

## The Fun Stuff:
- **Better AI Personalities**: Made Ally, Barbie, and Callam more interesting to talk to. Ally's not just "trying not to repeat" anymore - she's "creative and talkative, always saying something interesting." Same spirit, better vibe.

- **System Watchdog**: Built a cool monitor script that keeps an eye on disk space, memory, and network connection. It'll yell at me (nicely) if something's about to break. Added some fancy INFO/WARNING tags to make it extra clear.

- **Cleaner Chat Logic**: Stripped out some clunky instructions that were making our AI friends sound robotic. Also fixed an annoying bug where backticks were messing with image generation.

## Tech Details:
- **LLM Tuning**: Tweaked the language model settings for better conversations. Simplified the "sequence breaker" to just handle double newlines - sometimes less is more!

- **Configuration Update**: Moved `brain.sh` to use our battle-tested default config instead of experimental stuff. Stability for the win.

- **Dependencies**: Forked `llama-cpp-python` locally for better control. Sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.

- **Quick Fix**: Added proper `local` variable declarations in the `hello-sh` bash function. Small but important!

This project keeps getting better, and there's always something fun to improve. The AI personalities are really starting to shine, and the system's running smoother than ever. Looking forward to what next week brings!
