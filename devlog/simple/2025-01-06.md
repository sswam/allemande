# Devlog: Week of 2025-01-06 to 2025-01-12

Had fun tweaking our AI friends this week! Made them chattier and fixed some annoying quirks.

## The Good Stuff:

Our local AI pals (Ally, Barbie, and Callam) got personality upgrades. Cleaned up their core prompts to be more focused - like trimming Ally's verbose "You are Ally who is creative and always says interesting things" down to just "You are Ally. Ally is creative and talkative." Much better. Callam still talks like a pirate, because obviously.

Fixed up the Llama configs too. The text was getting a bit robotic and repetitive, so I played with the "dryness" settings until it flowed more naturally. Changed the sequence break marker to "-----" which helps conversations feel more organic. Still tweaking the exact numbers for `allowed_length`, `multiplier`, and `base`, but it's already way better.

Also corrected our Gemini model codes from "g"/"f" to proper "gp"/"gf". Small fix, but now the right model gets called every time.

The local AIs are really starting to develop their own personalities. Callam especially - trying to make a pirate AI that doesn't sound like a bad Hollywood clich√© is an interesting challenge. But when it works, it's pretty amazing watching these characters bounce off each other in natural ways.
