# Devlog: Making Ally Chat More Awesome

This week was all about making images better and adding some cool new features. Let me break it down:

**Image Generation is Way Better Now**
- Bumped up timeout to 3 minutes so complex images don't fail
- Added hi-res upscaling (150% more detail!)
- Two new image models: Coni and Boni for more creative options
- Images now display up to 90% of screen size (was 75%)
- Click handling: shift-click for same window, ctrl-click for new tab

**Fancy New File Recovery Tool**
Built a command-line tool called `recover_non_zero` that saves non-zero blocks from corrupted files. It's like digital archaeology - feed it data, and it'll extract anything that looks useful. Default block size is 512 bytes, but you can change it with `-b`.

**Better for New Users**
Cleaned up the new account message with clear instructions about rooms, AI chat, and that fun "poke" feature. Also added proper documentation for image dimensions with actual commands you can copy/paste.

**Under the Hood**
Tweaked the AI's creativity settings (top_p and top_k) to make conversations more interesting. It's like adjusting the seasoning - a little more spice, but not too wild.

All in all, Ally Chat is getting smoother, smarter, and more fun to use. The images look better, the AI's more engaging, and we've got some neat new tools to play with.
