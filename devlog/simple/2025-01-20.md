# Devlog: Week of 2025-01-20 to 2025-01-26

**Image generation got some love this week.** Extended the timeout to 5 minutes because some of you were making really complex art that needed more time to cook. Also added some spicy new detailing options for the Illy model - you know what I mean if you know what I mean. üòè

**Fixed an amusing bug where the conductor got confused by the word "System".** The conductor (which manages group chats) would see "System" in chat text and think it was another participant. Now it knows better. Look, even AIs need to learn who's actually in the conversation!

**Documentation and tools got better too.** Fixed the image dimension commands (it's "sets width=..." not "set width=..."), made the shell scripts smarter about finding media players, and fixed UTF-8 string handling in the TSV converter. Because who doesn't love correct character counts in their data processing?

These might seem like small changes, but they make Ally Chat smoother and more reliable. And hey, if you're generating AI art that takes more than 5 minutes, maybe it's time to dial back those prompt novels!

I'm having a blast building this thing, and every little improvement makes it better for everyone. Keep the feedback coming - even the weird bugs help make the app better.
