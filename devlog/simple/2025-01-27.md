# Week of 2025-01-27: Making Ally Chat's AI Friends More Real

Added JPEG support to the image generator and fixed some annoying metadata bugs. The images look just as good but the files are way smaller now. Each AI agent can choose whether they want JPEG or PNG - fancy!

Made the AI characters feel more like real people. Ally got a proper description now - she's Asian/European with long wavy blonde hair and brown eyes. Added a new friend called Emmie too. The AIs take turns talking naturally in group chats instead of all jumping in at once.

The conductor (the bit that manages conversations) got smarter. It can spot when someone's talking to "everyone" or "anyone" and pick random AIs to respond. It's also better at following who's talking to who.

Created some template files for different types of AI agents:
- Portal agents (the Llama characters with Stable Diffusion art)
- Programming agents (they can run Python, Node, Lua, Ruby, etc)
- Remote agents (Claude, GPT-4, and friends)

Still need to figure out where to store all the config stuff - maybe on each machine, maybe on a central server. But the AI friends are feeling more and more like real characters you can chat with.

The whole thing's coming together nicely. Who knew making AI friends could be this fun?
