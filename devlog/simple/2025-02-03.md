# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-03 to 2025-02-09

Made some exciting progress on the AI chat system this week! Added new agent personalities, improved the chat interface, and squashed some annoying bugs.

## New AI Friends Join the Party
Added three new AI agents: Dali (the artsy one), Cloe (ancient wisdom with attitude), and Summar (the historian who keeps track of everything). They can all chat together now - just mention multiple agents or say "everyone" to get a group conversation going. The conductor bot got smarter about managing these multi-agent chats too.

## Chat Interface Leveled Up
Finally added proper tab key support (coders rejoice!), fixed those pesky room number bugs, and made keyboard shortcuts more sensible. Alt-Z for undo feels much more natural now. Also wrote a neat script to compact those text files with too many image lines.

## Image Generation Got Fancier
- Added a retry button because sometimes art needs a second take
- Made images bigger (90% of viewport - go big or go home!)
- Added HQ macro processing for when you need that extra quality boost
- Fixed PNG-to-JPEG conversion doing weird things with metadata
- Service now retries failed generations after a quick breather

## Under the Hood
Added proper type annotations because future-me deserves nice things. The code's cleaner now and MyPy is happier. Also tweaked the VPN setup and switched default models to `claude` and `gpt-4o-mini`.

All in all, the system's getting more capable and more fun to use. Can't wait to see what these AI agents cook up in their conversations!
