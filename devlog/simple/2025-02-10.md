# Devlog: Week of 2025-02-10

Made some awesome progress on the chat app this week! Added new AI friends, better image generation, and lots of quality-of-life improvements.

## Chat Gets Better
- Two new AI characters: Akane and Nixie, each with their own personality
- Smarter conversations with alternating context for more natural back-and-forth
- Built-in text editor that knows what kind of file you're working with
- Better file handling and content filtering to keep things clean

## AI Art Leveled Up
- Now saves the seed for each image so you can recreate your favorites
- Much faster updates (0.1s polling instead of 1s)
- Changed prompt separator from `--` to `NEGATIVE` for clearer negative prompts

## Under the Hood
- Remote AI configs for Claude, Clia, Dav, and Emmy
- Added programming language sandboxes
- PulseAudio output switching (because why not?)
- Citation support for Perplexity API (so you know where stuff comes from)
- Better resource monitoring on Linux
- Safer file operations (no more sneaky dashes causing trouble)
- More type annotations for cleaner code
- Test generator now lets you test specific functions

## Nginx Note
Set up CORS header so `chat.allemande.ai` can talk to the webchat server. Small change, big impact.

The whole system's getting more polished and powerful every week. Really enjoying watching it grow into something special. Still lots to do, but we're getting there!
