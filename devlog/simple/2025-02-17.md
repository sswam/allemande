# Devlog: Allemande Updates (Feb 17-23, 2025)

Had a fantastic week improving Allemande's chat platform! Made the whole system smarter, faster, and more fun to use. Here are the highlights:

**Webchat Gets Superpowers**
- Fixed security with proper cross-origin headers
- Made D3 and Graphviz play nice together (finally!)
- Better error logging and HTML handling
- Custom HTML insertion for more flexibility

**AI Agents Level Up**
- Moved agent configs to YAML (bye bye hardcoding!)
- Better visual prompts for image generation
- Optimized context and model usage to keep costs down
- New room archiving system that actually makes sense

**Cool New Tools**
- Rebuilt 'aligno' text alignment tool in Go (much faster now)
- Added file deduplication with smart linking
- Implemented Google Search API via Serper Dev
- Better YAML handling for hybrid files

**Quality of Life Improvements**
- Cleaned up the codebase (it's beautiful now)
- Made secrets handling more flexible
- Reduced log noise in the conductor
- Added better chat room guides
- Fine-tuned Illu's personality and prompts

The platform is really coming together nicely. I'm particularly excited about the new agent management system - it makes adding and tweaking AI personalities so much easier. And the webchat improvements mean everything runs smoother for users.

Next up: More chat features and probably some fun experiments with the new search capabilities. Stay tuned!
