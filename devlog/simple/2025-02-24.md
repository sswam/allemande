# Devlog: Making AI Chat Better - Late Feb 2025

This week was exciting - we added new AI friends to chat with, made them look better, and gave them more personality. The chat interface is smoother too. Here's what's new:

## New AI Models
Added Grok and the latest Claude (3.7 Sonnet) to our AI roster. These models are pretty sharp - they think things through before responding, which leads to better conversations.

## Better Looking AI Characters
Big improvements to how AI characters look in generated images. We split up things like clothes, age, and mood into separate controls. The new "person" template makes AI portraits look way more consistent and natural, especially for bust shots.

## Smarter Prompting
Added some cool shortcodes that let prompts include random elements, weighted choices, and if-then logic. It's like giving the AIs more ways to be creative and unpredictable (in a good way).

## Cleaner Chat Interface
- Fixed some annoying bugs with images and service workers
- Better keyboard shortcuts for room navigation
- Smoother image handling and sizing
- Small visual tweaks to make everything look nicer

## Other Good Stuff
- Added more AI characters with interesting personalities
- Updated how image generation works to be more reliable
- Better file handling behind the scenes
- Cleaner documentation, especially around which AI models work online vs offline

The whole system is getting more polished and capable. These improvements make chatting with AIs feel more natural and fun, while keeping everything running smoothly under the hood.
