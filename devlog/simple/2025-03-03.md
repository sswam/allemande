# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09

**Made the AI agents smarter and more fun**
Completely rebuilt how AI characters work under the hood. Now we've got Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Buffy, and even Xena hanging out in chat. The AIs are better at staying in character and can chat for longer without getting confused. Each agent gets their own personality settings and can control how they look in generated images.

**Chat interface is way smoother now**
Rewrote the webchat stuff to make it less clunky. New users get a nice intro, NSFW content is properly managed, and you can customize your chat theme. Added keyboard navigation for folders because clicking everything is for chumps.

**Better image handling across the board**
The vision APIs now handle images properly between different AI services. No more weird size issues or format problems - it just works. Plus the AI characters generate more consistent visuals of themselves.

**Technical bits that got fixed:**
- Created proper `Agent` and `Agents` classes for better code organization
- Fixed race conditions in `atail.py`
- Added recursive container balancing for i3 windows
- Improved system prompt handling
- Added a cool `<think keep=1>` tag for context persistence
- Base files now use .base instead of .template (cleaner!)
- Better Markdown and code block rendering
- Smarter disk space monitoring

The agent system is really coming together now. Having characters like Big Bird and Buffy who can actually maintain their personalities while having deep conversations is pretty amazing. Plus they can generate consistent images of themselves - Cookie Monster always looks like Cookie Monster should.

All the boring technical stuff needed fixing too, but the end result is worth it: a chat system where AIs and humans can hang out together naturally.
