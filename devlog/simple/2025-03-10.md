# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-10 to 2025-03-16

Made some great progress on Allemande this week! The platform keeps getting better with improvements to our AI agents, a slicker webchat interface, and rock-solid infrastructure updates.

## Agent Upgrades
- Split clothing descriptions into upper/lower body for better image generation
- Standardized age settings and system prompts across agents
- Added fun new agents including Big Bird, Cookie Monster, and the Muppets (even Trump and Elon, because why not?)

## Webchat Gets Fancy
- Room management with Alt+M for renaming/moving
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks (looks sweet!)
- New compact view mode that plays nice with mobile
- Better image handling and display controls
- Toggle-able highlighting because options are good
- Light mode support for code blocks (for you monsters who prefer it)

## Under the Hood
- Fixed some nasty race conditions in file processing
- Beefed up error handling around file watching
- Upgraded to ruamel.yaml from PyYAML
- Added CUDA support for CTranslate2
- New dependencies: whisperx, pdfminer, optree

## Documentation & Quality of Life
- Added quick start guides for chat and image generation
- New safety docs and help info
- Script to launch xterms for services
- Git history viewer with patches
- CSS tools for compacting and searching
- Better folder navigation with up arrows

Allemande's getting more powerful and polished every week. The platform's growing into something really special - can't wait to see where it goes next!
