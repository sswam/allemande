# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-17 to 2025-03-23

**Added a bunch of new AI art toys to play with**
Got three shiny new AI art models up and running - Hily (great for fantasy art), Dily, and Wili. Each brings something special to the table. Hily is based on LEOSAM's HelloWorld XL and makes particularly nice fantasy scenes.

**Regional prompting is a game-changer for image generation**
You can now tell the AI different things for different parts of the image. Want a sunset in the top half and a castle in the bottom? No problem. The A1111 client supports all kinds of cool parameters for this - ratios, flipping, different modes like columns and rows.

**Making our AI friends smarter and prettier**
Added Gemmi (running on Gemini 2.0 Pro), fixed some visual bugs, and generally made the agents better at being themselves. Cleaned up their configurations and made sure they play nice with each other.

**Documentation that doesn't suck**
Wrote proper guides for the basics of AI art generation, how to use regional prompting, and how to get structured output from the LLMs that actually makes sense. Markdown beats JSON most days.

**Quality of life improvements**
- Click-to-copy code blocks (finally!)
- Fixed fonts in SVG elements
- Images now display properly for new users
- Added an "anime3d" style for those sweet 3D anime effects
- Better negative prompts for both anime and photo styles

**Under the hood**
Fixed some annoying bugs with macro parsing and permissions. The `awatch` command now properly tracks symlinked files (hey, it's important). Added some missing Debian packages that were causing headaches.

The platform keeps getting better, and there's always more cool stuff in the pipeline. Come play with our growing collection of AI toys!
