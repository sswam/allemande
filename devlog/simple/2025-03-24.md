# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-24 to 2025-03-30

**Mermaid diagrams rock Ally Chat.** After adding Graphviz, I figured why stop there? Now you can create flowcharts and sequence diagrams right in chat using Mermaid's markdown-like syntax. The implementation hooks Mermaid's JS library into our webchat to render diagrams as SVG. Had to tweak some CSS to play nice with Mermaid's labels, but it's working beautifully now.

**AI art got a serious upgrade.** Added a bunch of new models (Broni, Chilli, Furii, etc.), made regional prompting way more powerful, and threw in some handy shortcuts like `[L3]` for quick dimension/quality settings. The regional prompter now has a threshold setting and plays nicely with PAG. Capped the steps at 150 though - gotta keep the GPU from melting.

**Made the AI agents less... extra.** They were coming on a bit strong at first, so now they ease into conversations more naturally. Added age fields to all agents (because why not?) and cleaned up how personality traits are handled. Oh, and Trump and Musk got the boot - we've got better characters now.

**Chat editing that actually makes sense.** Added proper message editing with meta commands, history editing functions, and a soft undo feature. Yes, there's a confirmation dialog for undo, but you can bypass it with shift if you're feeling confident.

**Other cool stuff:**
- DeepSeek models are in the house
- Bigger send button (your thumbs will thank me)
- Better docs for everything
- Stop sequences to keep LLMs from impersonating others
- Gemmi upgraded to Gemini 2.5 Pro
- File formatting for HTML, SVG, XML and CSS

The platform's growing fast, but staying true to its roots - powerful, flexible, and fun to use. And yes, I'm still tweaking things every day because perfect is never finished.
