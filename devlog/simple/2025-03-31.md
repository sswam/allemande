# Devlog: Week of 2025-03-31 to 2025-04-06

Ally Chat leveled up this week with major improvements to both user experience and AI capabilities. I also built some sweet developer tools that make coding way more fun.

## Chat Interface Upgrades
- Added smooth scrolling controls and room management menus
- Simple mode toggle for new users (but kept file uploads, because who doesn't need those?)
- Switched to IBM Plex Sans font - finally, 'I' and 'l' don't look identical!
- Message IDs now available (always-on or hover)
- Fixed that annoying bug where deleted images showed up in the viewer

## AI Getting Smarter
- Added OpenRouter support with Mavi and Skout models
- Made image generation better with improved prompting for Illu and Pixi
- Cool new Markdown trick: `include` directive for embedding files and URLs
- Better code block handling (because ugly code blocks make me sad)

## Developer Tooling
Built some stuff that makes coding less painful:
- Git shortcuts that actually make sense (like `ad` for add, `st` for status)
- AMPS: A new shell-based actor programming system
	- Handles dependencies automatically
	- Makes pretty graphs with graphviz
	- Yes, I know it's weird to build this in shell. That's what makes it fun!

## Under the Hood
- Split up that monster `chat.py` file into something manageable
- Cleaned up dependencies (goodbye unnecessary Gradio!)
- Fixed path handling in `env.sh`
- Made the build process suck less

Pretty productive week! The chat's getting smarter, faster, and prettier. More cool stuff coming soon...
