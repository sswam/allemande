# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-07

Big week for Ally Chat! Added some fancy new AI models, made markdown work better, and sprinkled in some nice UI improvements. Let me break it down for you:

## New AI Friends
- Added Alibaba's Qwen models (QwQ 32B and EVA Qwen2.5-72B)
- Brought in Gemma and friends through OpenRouter
- Tuned up existing models like Gemini for better performance
- Made sure all our AI agents are properly adult-aged and well-dressed üòâ

## Markdown Magic
Fixed up some annoying edge cases:
- Inline math now works properly (no more broken LaTeX!)
- Code blocks handle whitespace better
- Tables convert cleanly using the CSV module
- Added KaTeX rendering right in the chat window

## Useful Tools
- Added a GPU memory usage reporter (`nvidia_usage.py`)
- New firewall management script for remote users
- Better editor shortcuts (dedent/indent)
- Disabled nginx caching that was causing headaches

## Under the Hood
- Updated all the AI agent configs to be more consistent
- Added some safety guardrails for image generation
- Fixed Perplexity's stop sequence handling
- Cleaned up dependencies and build process

Next up: More AI personality tweaks, looking into math-to-speech, and keeping the markdown renderer happy. The platform's growing nicely - might even sell some profile card packs like Pokemon cards. Hey, a dev's gotta eat! üÉè
