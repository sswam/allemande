# Devlog: Making Ally Chat Better Every Day

Got a ton done this week! Ally Chat is growing into quite the beast, with better setup, new AI friends, and some sweet UI improvements.

**Installation Smoothness**
Finally squashed those pesky install bugs! The setup scripts now handle domains and secrets properly, and nginx/haproxy configs are working beautifully. No more mysterious fails during install - it just works.

**New AI Buddies**
Added two fun new agents to chat with:
- Rocki: Running on the Grok-3 model, bringing fresh personality to the mix
- Borat: Very nice! Made with Llama model, great success!

**Code Cleanup**
Did some spring cleaning in the codebase:
- Centralized JavaScript functions for better organization
- Beefed up testing, especially for atail.py
- Added cool utilities like venv_move.sh for Python environment management
- File watching is more robust now with awatch.py improvements

**Better Docs**
Updated all the guides with clearer instructions for:
- UI features and how to use them
- Installation steps
- Setting up secrets and CUDA support

**UI Goodies**
The chat interface got some love:
- Added audio controls for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- New privacy indicator shows if you're in public or private mode
- 3-level compact view for those who like things tidy
- Smoother scrolling because nobody likes janky UIs

Everything's coming together nicely! The goal is to make Ally Chat not just powerful, but actually fun to use. Still lots to do, but it's getting better every week.
