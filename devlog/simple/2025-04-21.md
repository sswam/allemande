# Devlog: Week of 2025-04-21 to 2025-04-27

The Ally Chat dev kitchen has been cooking up some tasty improvements this week! Let me share the spiciest bits:

**Made the UI way more fun to use:**
- New draggable help widget that you can resize and maximize
- Added a table of contents view for navigating long chats
- Improved controls and touch behavior (iOS folks, you can pull-to-refresh now!)
- Three view modes: simple, advanced, and full-on boffin mode

**AI agents got some serious upgrades:**
- Started work on Gily, a new OpenAI image agent
- Added character agents Fli, Gemm, and Evan to the crew
- Upgraded Eva's personality and boosted Poli and Summi to gemini-2.5-flash
- Fixed agents talking to themselves (unless you explicitly ask with @)

**Under the hood improvements:**
- Nginx configs are now more secure and handle CORS better
- Added cache-busting so you always get fresh assets
- Moved user stuff to a better location
- Built scripts to clean up old images and audit remote users
- Fixed various typos because spelling matters

The platform is getting smarter and smoother every week. I'm particularly stoked about the new help widget - it makes the whole system way more approachable while keeping all the power-user features intact.

Next week we'll keep pushing forward with more AI capabilities and UI refinements. This project just keeps getting more exciting!
