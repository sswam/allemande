# Devlog: Making Ally Chat Better

This week was all about polishing up Ally Chat with new features and fixes. We added some nice UI touches, beefed up the audio processing, and made the whole system more robust.

## The Good Stuff:

**Better UI Experience:**
- Added scroll buttons to the editor (no more getting lost in long texts!)
- Fixed that annoying tab cursor bug
- New users get a friendly intro with a helpful arrow pointing to the help button
- Switched to a cleaner light theme by default

**Audio Powers:**
- Now handles FLAC files like a champ
- Added translation option to whisper_cpp.sh because why not?

**Backend Improvements:**
- Built a sweet monitoring script to keep an eye on system health
- Set up proper security for remote users (they live in their own little box now)
- Updated to CTranslate2 v4.4.0 for better performance

**Code Cleanup:**
- Rewrote ffclip to be more reliable (and actually make sense)
- Made the documentation clearer and more consistent
- Fixed some quirks in the recording system

It's amazing how these small changes add up to make the whole platform smoother and more capable. Next week we'll keep pushing forward with more improvements. The goal is to make Ally Chat not just functional, but delightful to use.
