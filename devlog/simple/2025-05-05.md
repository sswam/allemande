# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-05

Made some great progress on Ally Chat this week! The platform's getting smarter and more stable, with better AI characters and some nice backend improvements.

**Cooler AI Characters**
- Added Ellie, Mirror, Baymax, Riley, and Yvonne
- Organized characters into proper categories (finally!)
- Updated Chaz to generate full AI character templates with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Upgraded to Grok-2/3 models (they're pretty slick)

**Better Network Mounting**
Built a robust mounting system that actually works:
- Lock mechanism to prevent mount chaos
- Smart timeout and keep-alive features
- Auto-mounting for LLM, Whisper and image processes

**Config & Documentation Love**
- More flexible config loading (tries `access.yml` before `.access.yml`)
- Updated all the guides
- Generated a sweet character list
- Added a tour for new users (because why not?)

**Stability Improvements**
- Image generation now retries properly instead of failing
- Fixed that annoying webchat help file overwrite issue
- Cleaned up some nginx config cruft

**UI Tweaks**
- Updated room limits
- Better diagram scaling
- Nicer light theme colors (your eyes will thank me)

The platform's really coming together nicely. Stay tuned for more cool features next week!
