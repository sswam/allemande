# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-12

The AI agents got some cool upgrades this week! We added new characters like Luna (a werewolf wilderness guide) and Sal (a charismatic pizza shop owner), while making existing agents smarter about staying in character and not impersonating each other.

The mention system is now pickier - agent names are case-sensitive and you need that "@" symbol for self-mentions and group shoutouts. It's a small change that makes things much clearer.

Privacy got a boost too - we killed Nginx access logging across the main site and chat rooms. Your conversations are your business.

For the artists out there, image generation got some nice improvements with new realism techniques and assets. The Illu agent learned some new tricks for handling multiple characters in scenes (regional prompting is your friend here).

Some other neat stuff:
- Added a script to whitelist SSH IPs for a week
- Fixed that annoying bug with message undo counters
- Cleaned up the room configs and improved agent name matching
- Made markdown play nicer with newlines

The core focus was making our AI characters more distinct and reliable while keeping your chats private and fluid. Looking forward to seeing what creative things you all do with the improved tools!

Technical bits for the curious:
- Agent names are now stored/looked up case-sensitively
- Direct reply target validation ensures replies only go to active chat participants
- The conductor supports dynamic mediator assignment via "anyone"
- New realism LoRAs and tags for image generation
- Regional prompting highly recommended for multi-character scenes
