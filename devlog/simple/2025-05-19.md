# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-19 to 2025-05-25

The AI chat platform got some sweet upgrades this week. We're making the AI agents smarter, the images more realistic, and the whole system smoother.

## The Good Stuff:

**Better AI Images**
- New 'real' style preset that actually looks real (wild, right?)
- Fine-tuned the LoRA weights for more natural results
- Tried fixing the eternal "weird AI hands" problem (still a work in progress...)

**AI Agent Upgrades**
- Several agents got personality tweaks and better visual descriptions
- Updated Illu and Pixi with improved prompting and documentation
- Gave Jily a nickname: "Illy" (because why not?)

**Fancy New AI Models**
- Added Claude 4 Opus to the lineup (available as Claudo)
- Updated Claude Sonnet and Gemini configurations
- Renamed some internal stuff to make more sense

**Quality of Life**
- Fixed that annoying image swipe bug (no more accidental dragging)
- Cleaned up some backend scripts
- Various visual tweaks to make everything prettier

The platform's getting better every week. The images are looking more natural, the AI personalities are more consistent, and the whole system runs smoother. Still fighting with those AI-generated hands though - they're the bane of my existence, but we'll crack it eventually!

These improvements are making the chat experience more immersive and natural. Looking forward to what we can do next week!
