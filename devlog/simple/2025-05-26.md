# Devlog: Week of 2025-05-26 - Making AI Characters More Human

This week was all about making our AI characters feel more real and relatable. We upgraded their visual generation system, added some new personalities to the mix, and polished up the user experience.

## Visual Generation Gets a Major Upgrade
The AI can now create more diverse and emotionally expressive character images:
- Added proper facial features and hairstyles for different ethnicities
- Built a new emotion system that shows how characters are feeling
- Refined age options from young adult to elder
- Implemented celebrity-inspired appearances (think "has a bit of Meryl Streep energy")
- Added a fun Pony character generator with custom features

## Meet the New AI Friends
- Dax: Your quirky buddy with an offbeat sense of humor
- Eli: Makes complex stuff simple without being condescending
- Clair: Talks like a real person, not a robot trying to pass the Turing test
- Updated several existing characters to be more distinct and engaging

## Quality of Life Improvements
- Dark theme is now default (your eyes can thank me later)
- Better URL handling for sharing complex links
- Smarter folder views that actually work in Firefox
- New browser extension for exporting tabs to TSV
- Tweaked the AI personalities to chat more naturally
- Fixed some annoying timeout and process handling issues

## Story Generation Updates
- More flexible prompt modification options
- Better error handling (one bad image won't crash your whole story)
- Added safe content guidelines for Pony-style art

All these changes make the AI characters feel more like individuals you'd actually want to chat with, rather than generic chatbots. The diversity in appearances and personalities makes for more engaging and meaningful interactions.
