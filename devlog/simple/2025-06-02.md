# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-02 to 2025-06-08

We poured a lot of love into the agent system this week, made image generation better, and cleaned up a bunch of dependencies. The agents are getting smarter and more versatile, and the chat experience keeps getting better.

## The Good Stuff:

**Agent System Got Beefier:**
- Now loads agents from all parent directories (no more lost agents!)
- Added global agent definitions in `.agents_global.yml`
- Agents can now have more natural age descriptions like "25 years old"
- Fixed some annoying file path bugs

**Dependencies Finally Make Sense:**
- Updated PyTorch to 2.6.0 with separate installs for CPU/CUDA/ROCm
- Organized AI provider libraries into a clean `requirements-llm.txt`
- Moved Pillow where it belongs (in core requirements)

**New Characters in Town:**
- Meet Chas, our character design specialist who can work with reference images
- Added Cassie (tough cop) and six other interesting characters
- Updated several existing agents with better prompts and configs
- Gemmy retired (RIP Gemini 1.5 Pro)

**Web Chat Getting Fancy:**
- Boffin mode is now dev-only (sorry, power users!)
- Cleaned up the UI a bit
- Made undo work better with file processing
- Fixed some navigation quirks in the editor

**Image Generation Level Up:**
- Added "pretty" and "ugly" LoRA options (because sometimes you want ugly)
- New close-up poses for Illu
- Better documentation for visual prompts (spaces > underscores, folks!)

The best part? The whole system is becoming more robust and user-friendly while keeping all the power under the hood. We're not just fixing bugs - we're making AI chat more natural and fun.

That's all for this week! If you want to try out the new characters or play with the improved image generation, jump right in. The agents are waiting to chat!
