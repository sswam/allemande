# Devlog: Ally Chat Updates - June 2024

**New friends join the party, and our artists got an upgrade!**
We added some fun new AI personalities this week, including Murphy (a mischievous goblin thief), Novi (our master storyteller), and Aethon (an orc who paints landscapes). Plus, our image generation crew (Illu and Pixi) learned some new tricks with LoRA support - think of it like giving them special artistic styles to play with.

**Technical stuff that makes everything better:**
- Added dynamic date/time variables so our AI friends know when they're chatting
- Fixed temperature settings for different AI models (basically how creative they get)
- Made the help system more noticeable with a fancy '?' icon
- Added support for right-to-left text messages
- Improved our image generation documentation (those Poni and Coni models needed some explaining!)

**The fun details:**
Our image generation got a serious boost - Illu can now use "pretty" and "ugly" LoRAs to fine-tune exactly how artworks look, and Pixi got better at understanding what users want. The web chat looks nicer too, and we cleaned up a bunch of small issues that were bugging us.

I'm particularly excited about Murphy - who doesn't want to chat with a goblin thief? And Aethon's landscape paintings are turning out beautifully. The whole system feels more alive with these new personalities around.

Some boring-but-important stuff got fixed too, like YouTube embed privacy and temperature clamping for the AI models. But mostly, it was a week of making the chat more fun and the art more awesome.
