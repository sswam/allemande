# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-16 to 2025-06-22

We've been busy adding cool new AI personalities and making everything prettier and smoother. Here's what's new:

## New AI Friends
- **Azazel**: A sarcastic demon who's hilariously annoyed at being here
- **Frank, Klaud, and Veri**: Three new skeptical agents who keep things honest and real
- **Logi**: Our new logic specialist who breaks down problems step-by-step
- **Baymax**: Healthcare companion got tweaked to be more caring
- Also upgraded several existing agents like Chaz (now faster) and Illu (better at art)

## Visual Magic
- New flower-generation system for prettier images
- Better text overlays on images
- Smarter gender handling in image prompts
- Cleaned up how we generate photos

## Tech Stuff That Actually Matters
- Added Google Gemini vision support - now we have another way to understand images
- Made HAProxy configuration less painful
- Built a script to convert Point-Alpaca models to GGUF format
- Started work on "Flix" - a browser extension to manage streaming services

## Behind the Scenes
- Moved personal agents to their own directory (keeping things tidy)
- Added some deep thoughts about AI consciousness and ethics
- Fixed that annoying access rule bug in ally_room.py
- Made the help button easier to find

## Extra Goodies
- Simple command-line chat client for OpenAI
- Desktop notifications
- Better documentation for all our weird and wonderful features

This week was productive as hell, and we're just getting started. The AI characters are getting more interesting, the visuals are getting prettier, and everything's running smoother. It's amazing what you can build when you're having fun with it.
