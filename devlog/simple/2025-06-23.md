# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-23 to 2025-06-29

Our AI chat party got even more interesting this week! We added some fun new characters, made the art generation better, and cleaned up a bunch of stuff behind the scenes.

## New Friends Join the Chat
- **Lyra**: A peppy fitness coach to get you moving
- **Aidi**: Tech support that won't make you want to throw your computer
- **Misti**: Our first furry/pony character (yes, really!)
- **G-Chan & Sixl**: Art specialists who actually know what they're doing
- **Yenta**: Like a matchmaker, but for finding the right AI to talk to

## The Art Got Better
- Added proper support for furry and pony art styles
- Fixed those annoying text artifacts in generated images
- Made the image generation queue actually fair (no more queue-jumping!)

## Quality of Life Stuff
- NSFW content stays where it belongs
- New users get a starter guide that actually helps
- Made the help text less confusing
- The UI divider doesn't fight you anymore

## Tech Upgrades
- Added support for GGUF models (fancy new AI tech)
- Built some admin tools that don't suck
- Implemented a smart queue for art generation
- The responsible human for each chat is now tracked

## Behind the Scenes
- Cleaned up a bunch of agent prompts
- Removed Disney characters (lawyers, you know?)
- Made Flint less chatty on startup
- Added proper user management tools

Most exciting week yet! The AI characters are getting more specialized and interesting, the art generation is getting seriously good, and everything's running smoother. Stay tuned for more updates!
