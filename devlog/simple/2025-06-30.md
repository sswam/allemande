# Devlog: Week of 2025-06-30

A fantastic week of upgrades to my AI chat platform! After a refreshing 2-week break, I dove back in with major improvements to agents, visuals, and UI.

## Agent Updates
Added dozens of new agent personality summaries and refined existing ones. Introduced Lyro, a specialist in optimizing AI prompts. Agents now have trading card-style character profiles with bios, interests, and fun facts. Fixed some annoying crash bugs in agent settings too.

## Visual Upgrades
Image generation got way cooler this week:
- New tall and wide aspect ratios (just use "T" or "W")
- Added a LoRA for generating plastic clothing effects
- Watercolor portrait generation
- Better prompts with refined negative terms

## Holographic Trading Cards!
The profile cards got a major glow-up - they're now 3D holographic cards with tilt effects, shine, and custom gradients based on the agent's profile pic colors. Works great on mobile too. I might actually sell card packs someday...

## Quality of Life
- System messages now stay hidden (less chat clutter)
- New utility scripts for relative symlinks
- Added a line-splitting script for numbered files
- Screen logs now properly go to stderr

The agents are getting smarter, the art is getting better, and those holographic cards are just plain fun. Can't wait to see what next week brings!
