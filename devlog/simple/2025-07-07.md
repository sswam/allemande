# Devlog: Week of 2025-07-07 to 2025-07-13

Added a bunch of cool stuff to Ally Chat this week! The focus was making everything faster, safer, and more capable. Also got tired of writing these devlogs by hand, so I made a script to generate them from git history.

## New AI Friends
Added several new AI personalities (Allie, Ellen, Lori and more) and upgraded the existing ones with better models like Llama 3.3 70B. They now support character cards - think AI trading cards but actually useful. Also cleaned up the agent directory structure because holy organizational debt, Batman.

## Pretty Pictures Got Prettier
Added some fancy new art styles including watercolor and Van Gogh-style. There's even a new plastic clothes LoRA, which sounds weird but makes generated outfits look way more realistic. Updated the prompts too - no more accidental feminine features on male characters.

## Making Things Nice for Users
Rewrote the welcome message so new users don't feel lost. Made usernames case-insensitive (because who remembers exact capitalization?). Sessions now expire after 7 days - security first, folks. Also fixed some UI annoyances in chat rooms and profile cards.

## Backend Magic
Built some handy utility scripts for linking files and managing git history. Made error handling actually helpful instead of silently failing. Logs now go where they're supposed to (stderr gang rise up). Also added tracking for timed-out jobs because losing track of those was driving me nuts.

The platform's really coming together! Next week I might actually sell those AI trading cards. The app's free, but servers aren't...
