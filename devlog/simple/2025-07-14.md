# Devlog: Week of 2025-07-14 - Cool New Stuff in Ally Chat

**Ally Chat got some major upgrades this week.** The AI agents are smarter, the art generation is better, and everything's more secure and user-friendly. Here's what's new:

## AI Agents & Characters
- Meet Bish, our new real-time translator who helps users chat across languages
- Loni (formerly Lori) got upgraded to Gemini 2.5 Flash - she's way smarter now
- Added Frank, who keeps things safe and gives honest feedback
- Characters can now seamlessly hand off conversations to specialists while staying in character
- Organized agents into categories like "comedy" because why not have fun with it?

## Better Art Generation
- Multiple image prompts in one message - go wild!
- Upload your own LoRA files for custom art styles
- Added "boring LoRA" and "strong face" options (trust me, they help)
- Images now have three view modes: normal, blurred, and off
- Fixed that annoying HTML bug with LoRA tags

## Security & User Experience
- Usernames can't start with dashes
- Sessions expire after 7 days - keeps things fresh
- New users get a proper welcome now, with custom guides
- Long directory names get truncated but show full on hover
- Killed some annoying keyboard shortcuts in chat

## Backend Stuff
- Automated .safetensors file handling
- DeepSeek models now route through OpenRouter (free!)
- Better error handling everywhere
- Higher limits on image generation queues
- Added tools to share these devlogs

The platform's evolving fast, and there's tons more coming. Who knew AI chat could be this much fun to build?
