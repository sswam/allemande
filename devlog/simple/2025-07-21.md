# Devlog: Week of 2025-07-21 to 2025-07-27 - Making Everything Better

Holy crap, we did a lot this week! The AI agents got way smarter, art generation got fancier, and we added some sweet new admin tools. Let me break it down for you:

**AI Agents Just Leveled Up**
- New base configs (SmallAI, MediumAI, StrongAI) to make agents more consistent
- Switched some agents to better models (DeepSeek, Llama, Gemini)
- Added Venice Uncensored model and some fun new characters
- Fixed up various agent prompts to be clearer and behave better
- Told the AIs to chill with the emoji spam

**Art Generation is Getting Fancy**
- Added Shane Glines Pony styles (they look amazing!)
- New Ghibli-style macro for those Studio Ghibli vibes
- Bunch of new LoRA options for different art styles
- Sped things up by limiting generation steps to 30

**Admin Stuff That Actually Helps**
- New tools to find inactive users (goodbye ghost accounts)
- Scripts to fix common account problems
- Added a way to clean up empty room directories
- Better user management all around

**Quality of Life Updates**
- You can now delete files by saving them empty (so much easier!)
- Fixed markdown links to work properly with spaces and local files
- Turned image generation back on in private rooms for free users
- Better directory sorting and tab order that makes sense

**Backend Improvements**
- Better file serving with fallback options
- New union mount setup
- Auto-cleanup of temporary files

The platform's getting more powerful and easier to use every week. We're not just adding features - we're making everything work better together. And yes, I'm pretty stoked about those new art styles!
