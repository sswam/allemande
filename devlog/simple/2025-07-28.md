# Devlog: Week of 2025-07-28

Made some great progress on Ally Chat this week! The AI agents are getting smarter, the visuals are getting cooler, and everything's running smoother under the hood.

## AI Agents: Smarter & More Efficient
- Added new agent Cassie (Cassandra Steele)
- Switched several agents to `gemini-2.0-flash` model for better speed/cost ratio
- New "enabled" flag to easily toggle agents on/off
- Cleaned up names: Jaxx, Kriss, Anni (formerly Jax, Kris, Ani)
- Tightened up Azazel's character and switched Frida to MediumAI base

## Visual Magic
- Added retro-style Matrix falling characters effect
- New rain animation for chat rooms
- Both effects auto-disable for reduced-motion preference
- Fresh LoRAs for Illu: MS Paint Portrait, Inside Out, Ghibli styles

## Better User Experience
- Auto-generates unique colors for agent names in chat
- Fixed image generation in private rooms for free users
- Streamlined new user creation process
- Created `agent_colours.css` system for consistent styling

## Technical Improvements
- Daily reset for image generation quotas
- New `joine.sh` script for column-based file joining
- Added `irun.sh` for TTY input commands
- Message logging for better debugging
- Fixed queue scheduling for past-dated image jobs

The platform's really coming together - making it more fun and powerful while keeping everything running smoothly. Building something this cool is a blast!
