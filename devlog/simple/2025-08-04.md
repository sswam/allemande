# Devlog: Week of 2025-08-04

We've done some cool stuff with Ally Chat this week! The biggest change is making our AI agents more modular and easier to manage. Now they can inherit common settings from a base configuration, which means less copy-paste and more consistency.

## New Features & Improvements

**Davina Joins the Team:** Our new character agent uses special memory tags to keep track of conversations and backstory. Pretty neat!

**Quality of Life Updates:**
- Press Enter to close image viewer (finally!)
- More flexible usernames
- Persistent SSH connections
- YAML validation to catch config errors early

**Agent Cleanup:**
- Most agents now inherit from SmallAI.yml base config
- Optimized context windows for several agents
- Fixed some minor details (Illu's "multicolored" spelling, Hanni's eye color)
- Eva, Evan, and Qeva are now visual-only agents

## Under the Hood

**Infrastructure:** Added persistent SSH connections and better server management. The new `connects` script handles multiple servers smoothly.

**Tools & Scripts:**
- YAML validator for catching config errors
- Automatic agent summary generation
- Extra rooms directory support via sshfs
- Fixed think tags, Grok-4 stop sequence, and UI shortcut issues

**Image Updates:** The `image_text` function now supports horizontal text distribution with space-between alignment. Neat for creating more dynamic layouts.

This was a solid week of making things work better and smoother. Can't wait to see what you all do with the improvements!
