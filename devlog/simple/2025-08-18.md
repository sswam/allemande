# Devlog: Making Ally Chat Even Better (Aug 18-24, 2025)

Exciting week of improvements to make Ally Chat smarter and more capable! We've enhanced how AI agents work together, added new AI models, and made the whole experience smoother.

## Smarter Agent Teamwork
The agents got better at handing off tasks to each other. Now they can preserve context when switching (using `forward_keep_prompts`), and there's a backup plan if their first choice agent isn't available (`forward_if_disallowed`). The `ShowMI` image generation system is smarter about giving instructions and will automatically switch to `Illu` when needed.

## More AI Brains to Pick
- Direct integration with Venice.ai's uncensored model
- Added the new GPT-5 family: Heisen (full), Heise (mini), and Heis (nano)
- New open-source models: Goss (120B) and Gos (20B)

## Better Image Handling
- HEIC images now automatically convert to JPG
- AI agents can now "see" image alt text, making them better at understanding what they're looking at

## Polish and Quality of Life
- Custom error pages (with special NSFW versions!)
- Image search by alt text
- Cleaner agent responses with automatic dedenting
- More natural AI personalities (Aidi won't call you "sweetie" unless you start it)
- Streamlined regional prompting system
- Better welcome messages for new users
- Improved `awatch` tool for developers

## Bug Squashing
- Fixed `@` mentions so they don't trigger on email addresses
- Agents now stay quiet when mentioned if they're not actually there
- Better room archiving
- Fixed Juon's name in the guide (it's not "Jhon"!)

All these improvements make Ally Chat more powerful and fun to use. The new agent forwarding and AI models especially open up some exciting possibilities for the future!
