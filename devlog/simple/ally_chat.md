**Ally Chat: Your Gateway to AI Wonderland (2025 Update)**

We've built something pretty special here - an indie chat platform that lets you talk to 28 different AI models in one place. Think OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude all hanging out together.

The cool stuff:
- Multi-AI conversations (500+ AI characters to choose from!)
- Rich media support (images, videos, even little games)
- AI art generation with smart prompting help
- Interactive math tools with proper LaTeX rendering
- Loni: Our meta-AI who finds the perfect AI for whatever you need
- Create chat rooms instantly for any purpose
- Both family-friendly and adult spaces available

Some nerdy details I'm proud of:
- Full markdown/HTML support with CSS/JS capabilities
- WebGL and canvas for interactive elements
- Graphviz/Mermaid diagram generation
- Regional prompting for precise AI art control
- Integration with multiple AI vision models
- Real-time collaborative features

We're currently in closed beta, with a very generous free tier for early users. The whole thing is open source because we believe in transparency and community.

Want to try something different in the AI chat space? This is what we've been building for. Drop me a message for beta access - we'd love your feedback!
