### Putting every AI in one chat room, because why not?

I built [Ally Chat](https://allemande.ai) because I wanted something different - a place where any AI model can play with any other, and users get real power instead of training wheels.

Here's what makes it special:

- **Full HTML/JS in chat messages:** Not just markdown - you can embed live charts, videos, or whatever you dream up. Want sparkly rainbow text? Go for it.

- **AI orchestra at your command:** Mix and match models like `Emmy`, `Claude`, and `Gemmi`. Have them chat with each other. You're the conductor.

- **Massive AI lineup:** Nearly 400 models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and more. When new ones launch, we add them fast.

- **Real technical tools:** Generate diagrams with Graphviz/Mermaid, work with math notation, get coding help, create AI art right in chat. Actual useful stuff.

- **Your space, your rules:** Private rooms, public spaces, personal sandboxes. Adult content allowed if that's your thing. No corporate overlords telling you what's acceptable.

It's built for people who want to push boundaries and create cool things. A playground for the curious and technically minded, but without the usual limitations. Think of it as the power-user's AI chat platform.

I made it because I wanted these capabilities myself. Turns out lots of other people did too.
