**Ally Chat is leveling up its local AI capabilities**
Made some exciting progress integrating more local AI models into Ally Chat today. We've got Ollama running most of the popular open source models now - Mixtral, Phi-2, and even that cute little neural net Tinyllama. They're not as powerful as the cloud AIs, but they're FAST and they run right on your machine.

Cool new features:
- Local models run without internet connection
- Near-instant responses for basic tasks
- Mix and match with cloud AIs as needed
- Complete privacy for sensitive convos
- Zero cost per token

The integration was surprisingly smooth thanks to Ollama's clean API. Just had to wrangle some async code and error handling. Nothing too gnarly.

Next up: Adding RAG capabilities so these local models can access your private docs and code. Should make for some interesting use cases.

Think "AI assistant that actually knows your codebase" but without sending your source code to the cloud. Pretty neat, right?

Still lots to do, but it's awesome seeing these open source models getting more capable by the day. The future of AI isn't just in the cloud - it's right here on your laptop too.
