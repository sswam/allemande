Ally Chat is a unique multi-user chat platform integrating many AI models
from various vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Perplexity, xAI,
DeepSeek) and specialized tools.  Its novel features include:
- markdown-based chat supporting full HTML content (images, videos, embeds, diagrams, SVG, CSS, JS, ...);
- a flexible room system allowing private and public chats, personal rooms, and user-created spaces;
- a "conductor" that manages AI responses based on user mentions and cues;
- support for Graphviz and Mermaid diagrams;
- and a shared canvas for collaborative drawing using JavaScript.

The platform also offers free-speech (with NSFW options), programming
tools for seven languages, various search tools, and a diverse cast of AI
personalities, each with unique traits and capabilities. A key differentiator
is its robust support for AI-assisted learning within the main chat room,
guiding new users through its features.
