## Technology Innovation

### Live-Learning Models:

Our major innovation is a real-time learning system. Unlike static AI language models, our live models can learn from every interaction, continually studying and improving.

Example: When a user corrects the AI or provides new information, the system uses spaced repetition to reinforce this knowledge, gradually incorporating it into future interactions without overfitting.

#### Key Methods:

1. **Spaced-Repetition Curriculum Learning:** Efficient learning and revision without overfitting.
2. **Personal Fine-Tuning:** Utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRAs) for contextual and user-specific fine-tuning.
3. **Conversation Distinction:** Clear differentiation between "public," "personal," and "incognito" conversations.
4. **Contextual Adaptation:** Intelligent extraction of valuable information from conversation logs while maintaining user privacy.

### Advanced Memory Systems for Code, Text, and Media:

We are developing a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to complement neural network memory.

#### Key Capabilities:

1. **Text and Media Conversion:** Tools for converting formatted content into clean markdown or plain text.
2. **Hierarchical Summaries:** Creation of hierarchical summaries and cheat-sheets for better understanding of complex content.
3. **Dependency Mapping:** Mapping dependencies in code and other structured data to enhance AI understanding and analysis.

### Avoiding Hallucinations:

Our models prioritize intelligence and accuracy over comprehensive memory, ensuring reliable and trustworthy AI interactions.

#### Strategies:

1. **Embracing Uncertainty:** AI models recognize and express their own limitations.
2. **Research and Fact-Checking:** Robust integration systems for accessing and verifying information from reputable external sources.
3. **Transparent Communication:** Programming AI to clearly acknowledge gaps in knowledge and express uncertainties.

### Fine-Tuning with LoRAs:

Our modular Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) system allows for efficient combination of various capabilities with the base model.

#### Key Areas of Focus:

1. **Chat, Instruction, and Safety:** Fundamental LLMs implemented as adjustable LoRAs.
2. **Personality and Behaviour:** LoRAs for adjusting parameters like conciseness, playfulness, or specific writing styles.
3. **Specialized Knowledge:** Lightweight LoRA models for expertise in specific areas.
4. **Integrations:** LoRAs enabling advanced search, tool utilization, and external memory system integration.
5. **Self-Talk:** Enabling internal dialogue for idea refinement and independent thought processes.
6. **Scheduling and Initiative:** Training for time management and proactive engagement.
7. **Procedural Problem-Solving:** Encouraging methodical problem-solving approaches.
8. **Creativity:** Enhancing creative processes through structured approaches.
