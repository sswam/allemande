Extended output capabilities (beta)
Claude 3.7 Sonnet can produce substantially longer responses than previous models with support for up to 128K output tokens (beta)â€”more than 15x longer than other Claude models. This expanded capability is particularly effective for extended thinking use cases involving complex reasoning, rich code generation, and comprehensive content creation.

This feature can be enabled by passing an anthropic-beta header of output-128k-2025-02-19.
