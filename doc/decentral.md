I'm based in Australia, so this crap is concerning for my AI chat service too. Thinking along these lines:

- decentralize / federate under anons, possibly even p2p, too many / too dynamic to block
- receive support for developing the software, not for operations, at least nominally
- users (including me) can contribute with funded API keys and idle GPU resources
- continue to verify users' ages casually rather than strictly
