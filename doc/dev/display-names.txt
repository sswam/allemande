In my chat app, I want users to be able to use their first name as a display name. But what happens if two people have the same first name (which is likely) how can we deal with that?  The app also has a feature where mentioning someone's name notifies them.
Please reply as concise as possible, with no boilerplate or unnecessary explanation.

To handle multiple users with the same first name:

1. Add a unique identifier to each user's display name:
   - Use a combination of first name and a number (e.g., John1, John2)
   - Use first name and last initial (e.g., JohnS, JohnD)
   - Use username or a shortened version of it

2. Implement an autocomplete feature for mentions:
   - Show full name or additional info when typing @
   - Allow users to select the correct person from a list

3. Use unique user IDs for notifications:
   - Store mentions with user IDs instead of display names
   - Notify based on user ID, not display name

4. Allow users to customize their display names:
   - Provide options to add numbers or characters
   - Enforce uniqueness when setting display names

Choose the approach that best fits your app's design and user experience.

I am thinking that within a single conversation / chat room during a time period, display names should be unique, so if there are two Sam's, one of them had better be Sambo or Sam Jones or whatever. So maybe users can customize their display name in different rooms so long as it is unique within that room. Most rooms are 'rotated' daily (or regularly) and conversation history is moved elsewhere, so it won't have unlimited number of participants in the chat.

Your approach is sound. Implementing unique display names within each chat room for a given time period enhances clarity and prevents confusion. Allowing users to customize their names per room adds flexibility. Daily rotation of rooms with archived history manages scalability. This system balances user identification, customization, and efficient room management.
