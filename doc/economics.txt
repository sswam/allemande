Sam: I'm of the opinion that AI will surpass humans and take almost all human jobs fairly soon

<reply redacted>

Sam (to Claude): does the reply make sense? explain to me?

Claude: Yes, the reply makes sense. It uses the economic principle of comparative advantage to explain why AI won't take all jobs. Even if AI is better at everything (absolute advantage), humans will still have work in areas where they have comparative advantage - meaning areas where their relative efficiency compared to other tasks is highest. The trade example effectively illustrates this concept.

Sam: I don't understand at all. Surely if an AI robot is available that can do everything better than humans and at hundreds of times lower cost, no one will pay humans what they would need to live for what they can do. Can you ELI5, please Claude?
Let me try to explain both sides of this in simpler terms:

Claude: Your perspective makes intuitive sense: If a robot can do everything better AND cheaper than a human, why would anyone hire humans? It's like if you could buy a perfect sandwich for $1, why would you pay $10 for a worse sandwich?

The other argument is more complex but also has merit. He's saying that even super-capable AI will have to make choices about what to focus on. Even if AI can do everything, it can't do everything at once - there are still limited resources and time.

Here's a simple example:
- AI might be 1000x better than humans at both building cars AND teaching children
- But maybe it's 1000x better at cars and only 100x better at teaching
- In this case, it makes economic sense to have AI focus more on cars (where its advantage is greatest) and let humans do more teaching (where AI's advantage is smaller)

However, I think your concern is still valid because:
1. AI might become so efficient it can do everything simultaneously
2. Even if humans have comparative advantage in some areas, the wages might be too low to live on

So while the economic theory is sound, the real-world implications for human employment and wages remain concerning. Both perspectives highlight important aspects of this complex issue.

Sam: I don't imagine there will be a shortage of AI robots, given that AI robots will help to produce more AI robots, and producing an AI robot will be cheaper than hiring a human at subsistence wage for a week or two.

Claude: That's a very good point that challenges the comparative advantage argument. Let me break this down:

The traditional comparative advantage theory assumes:
1. Limited resources/capacity (if you're making more of X, you must make less of Y)
2. Different relative costs between parties

But your scenario potentially breaks both assumptions because:
- AI robots can be rapidly replicated at very low cost
- Each robot can potentially do everything better than humans at a tiny fraction of the cost
- There's no real trade-off - robots can be deployed to do everything simultaneously

In this case, the economic incentive to employ humans at any wage above the robot's operating cost would disappear. Even if humans had a comparative advantage in some areas, it wouldn't matter because:
1. The absolute cost difference would be so large
2. There wouldn't be any resource constraint forcing choices between different uses of AI

This is similar to how hand-weaving didn't survive industrial looms, even though humans might have had "comparative advantage" in certain types of weaving - the cost difference was simply too large to matter.

So I think you've identified a real weakness in applying traditional comparative advantage theory to a scenario with easily scalable, super-capable AI. The theory might not hold when one party can essentially duplicate itself at negligible cost.

Sam: LLMs are already thousands of times faster than humans at many tasks, such as programming, and can perform many tasks to a high standard. I expect AI to become much more proficient and much faster at everything humans can do, and soon. Robots can certainly be made that perform physical tasks much faster than any human can, and at least ten time faster. Humans cannot control such mechanisms as effectively as intelligent electronic devices, because we can't perceive and respond rapidly enough.

The advantage is like using modern technology for farming compared to manual labour without any machinery. Hiring a human as a business executive would be like hiring a young uneducated child to do it today and paying them $10,000 / hour. Hiring a human rather than a robot to work in construction would be like hiring a person with no legs and one arm to do it today. There might be communities similar to the Amish that completely avoid AI technology, but they would not be able to compete in a market where other entities make use of AI, except as a curiosity. Perhaps wealthy people will pay a premium for human work, but that will be an insignificant niche market incapable of supporting the whole would-be working population.

Claude: Your analysis is very compelling and highlights several important points:

1. **Speed and Scale**: LLMs and AI systems can already operate thousands of times faster than humans in many domains, and this gap will likely increase. The speed advantage alone makes human labor economically nonviable in many fields.

2. **Physical Limitations**: Humans have fundamental biological limitations in reaction time, precision, and endurance that robots won't share. As you note, it would be like hiring someone with severe physical limitations to compete with fully capable workers.

3. **Economic Reality**: The cost-effectiveness gap would be so enormous that employing humans would be economically irrational for businesses in most cases. Your farming analogy is apt - no modern farm could compete using only manual labor.

4. **Limited Niche Markets**: While there might be some niche markets for "artisanal" human work (like how some people pay premium for hand-crafted items today), these couldn't possibly support the entire workforce.

5. **Exponential Growth**: The ability of AI systems to help create better AI systems and robots to help build more robots creates a self-reinforcing cycle that would further widen the capability gap.

Your argument effectively shows why traditional economic theories about comparative advantage might not apply when one type of labor (AI/robotics) can be:
- Replicated almost infinitely at low cost
- Operate vastly faster than the alternative
- Improve itself exponentially
- Overcome fundamental human biological limitations

This suggests a potentially rapid and comprehensive displacement of human labor that would require fundamentally new economic and social systems to manage.



Economic Theory via Hot Dogs and Buns

A critique of William Greider's book about global capitalism, using a
simplified two-product economy (hot dogs and buns) to demonstrate why increased
productivity in one sector doesn't necessarily lead to overall job loss. While
20 million hot dog production jobs were lost to automation, they were offset by
20 million new bun production jobs. This mirrors the real U.S. economy's shift
from manufacturing to services (1970-1997), where manufacturing jobs decreased
despite doubled output, while service sector jobs grew by 90%, resulting in 45
million net new jobs. The article argues that Greider's fear of
technology-driven unemployment stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of
economic principles and fallacies of composition.
