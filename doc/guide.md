## Limitations

### Work in Progess

- **Storage**: We back up all chat and images, however the server has limited space. Images more than 7 days old might be removed. Save what you want to keep, or contact the developer to recover older images from the backup. We are working to fix this issue.
- **Immersion**: The step-by-step method we use for image generation can break immersion. We have some ideas to address this.
- **Notifications**: We're working on AI initiative and notifications, it's not done yet.
- **Voice Chat**: Voice chat is under development, it's going to be good!
- **Memory**: We don't have automatic memory systems for AI characters yet. You can implement this manually by asking Summi or another summary agent to make a summary, then pasting into a new chat, a mission file, or an agent character sheet.
- **Document Processing**: We are working on document conversion, vector embedding indexes and RAG to efficiently handle PDF documents and the like. It's not done yet.
- **Image Processing**: We don't have an img2img function yet, but the AIs can look at reference images for ideas if vision is enabled.

### Future Directions

- **Private Messaging**: We don't yet have a direct messaging feature
- **Video Generation**: We don't have AI video generation yet

## Learning about Ally Chat

- Read the [Quick Intro](/intro). It is not repeated here.
- Read this [User Guide](/guide) if you have time, or to see the lists of characters.
- This document is visible to AIs in the help widget. They can help users to learn about the app. They can even show which icons to press!
- IMPORTANT: New users who need help should talk to Aidi. Other characters can also help, but Aidi is specialised at this.
- A red dot at the top-right means you are disconnected or offline. Reload the page.
- For a simple chat experience, talk with Loni. She can direct your messages to many other agents as if by magic!
- Illu is expert at image generation. You can talk to her to make images or learn about image prompting. If an AI writes a prompt, the user needs to press "poke" to generate the image from the prompt. This can be a stumbling block for new users.
- Ask Yenta to introduce you to other characters, agents and even tools.
- You can contact Sam, the developer, who is happy to give help or a tour.
- Informed help from AIs is available in the help widget. Here, AIs have access to the entire user guide.
   - In the main "Ally Chat" room, AIs have some basic info about the app.
   - In other chat rooms, AIs do NOT have access to the guide, do not know how the app works, and can't offer sensible help on how to use the app.
   - Users can learn about the app using the help widget, and in the main "Ally Chat" room, then chat in other rooms once they know what they are doing.

- On mobile, you can [add the app to your home page](https://www.androidauthority.com/add-website-android-iphone-home-screen-3181682/) so that it feels more like a normal app:
> To add a website to your Android home screen, open the browser and go to the website. Open the More menu button and select Add to Home screen. Confirm, and it will appear on-screen.
On an iPhone, open Safari and go to the website. Tap the share menu and select Add to Home Screen. Confirm, and it will appear on-screen. However, the link will only work with Safari.

## Tools and Capabilities

Beyond regular chat, Ally Chat includes specialized agents for:

- Web searches
- Programming
- Calculations
- Shell commands
- And more!

Whether you're looking for casual conversation, technical help, or collaborative problem-solving, Ally Chat provides the tools and AI assistance you need.

## Getting Started

The main "Ally Chat" room is a "welcome lobby". AIs can chat with users, help them learn about the app's features, and introduce them to other characters and tools.

Room System:
1. The chat room can be changed by editing the name at the top of the app
2. New rooms can be created the same way

Types of Rooms:
- Home Folder: `username/*` (private chats with AI)  Note that the username is all lower case.
- Personal Public Room: `username` (public, user has moderator rights)
- Other Public Rooms: Any other top-level room (public, no special privileges)

Example for user "Alice":
- Private AI chats: `alice/chat`, `alice/thoughts`, etc.
- Her public room: `alice`
- Folder view of her files: `alice/`
- Other rooms: `general`, `music`, etc.
- Folder view of all top-level rooms: `/`

You can view your main private chat, your folder, your public chat, the top folder, and the Ally Chat room, by clicking your name at the top-right repeatedly. In advanced mode, there is a <i class="bi-compass"></i> nav menu at top-left with shortcuts to different rooms, and a <i class="bi-folder"></i> button to go up to the parent folder.

The folder view only allows to browse to different files and folders. To delete a file you need to click in to edit the file, then clear it.

To create a room or file, just type its pathname in the room field at the top of the app.

Ally Chat is continuously evolving with new features and capabilities being added regularly. We hope you enjoy exploring and using this unique chat platform!

## Basic Markdown

- The chat format is [markdown](/markdown), and supports images, tables, code, etc.
- Use *italics* for emphasis or to describe your thoughts and actions: `*italics*`
- Use **bold text** to highlight important points: `**bold text**`
- Include headings, images, links, code, and tables using [Markdown syntax](/markdown).

## Rich Chat Format

- We can also display TeX math, graphviz ```dot ...``` graphs, and ```mermaid ...``` diagrams.
- You can safely embed any HTML, including audio, video, embeds, canvas, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The chat is displayed in a secure cross-domain iframe, so JavaScript in the chat is not very dangerous.

## The conductor

1. If you mention an AI's name with a capital letter, they will respond. Priority is given to names at the start of your message, or at the end after a comma.

  - hey Ally, how are you?   - invokes Ally
  - I like Ally, Sam  - invokes Sam

2. If you don't mention anyone's name, the last other person in the chat will repond.

3. If you poke the chat, an AI mentioned in the last message, or the previous AI, will respond.

5. You can mention an AI in lower-case to avoid triggering them to respond.

6. If you say @anyone, a random AI from the chat will respond.

7. If you say @everyone, several AIs from the chat will respond.

8. You can "poke" the chat to get the next person to respond without saying anything yourself.

9. You can prompt several named people to respond like: @Ally, @Barbie, @Cloe ...

  - hey, Barbie... do you like ally?

10. You can invoke someone without saying anything like -@Ally

8. The conductor rules are a bit more complex than described above. If in doubt, use @ mentions.

## The Poke function

When your message box is empty, the <i class="bi-send"></i> **Send** button changes into the <i class="bi-hand-index-thumb"></i> **Poke** button.

Pressing **Poke** is often used to send an AI-written image prompt (like one from Illu) directly to an AI art model (like Jily).

It can also prompt the AIs to continue the conversation among themselves, or get the next AI to respond if you don't have anything to add.

**Poke** will usually trigger an AI to respond, except when two humans have been talking most recently. This is subject to change.

In an empty chat room, you can press Poke to have a random AI start the conversation. Only certain characters will do this.

## Basic intro to AI Image Generation

IMPORTANT: The agents Illu and Gema are experts on image gen. We can talk to them to learn about image prompting, much more than is in this guide.

This asks Jily, an image gen AI, to draw a big dog, in a fast, lowest-quality landscape image:

    Jily, big dog [L]

This draws Cloe in a green dress in a ballroom, with her default cheery expression, at the age of 30, in a high-quality portrait image. Try to get a full body shot by mentioning shoes or feet!

    Jily, [person "Cloe" "green dress" . "30"], ballroom, (full body, heels:1.5) [P4]

The "person" macro accepts up to 4 parameters.

Required parameter:
1. Character's name

Optional parameters (use "." for default, or "-" for none):
2. Clothing
3. Emotion/Facial expression
4. Age (or description of age)

NOTE: The position is important, e.g. to specify default clothes, no emotion, and custom age:

    Jily, [person "Ally" . - "adult 40 years old"], standing [P2]

The shortcut quality settings range from 0 (lowest, the default) to 4.

[S2] is a good quality square image. [P1] is a low quality portrait image, [L4] is a very high quality landscape image, etc.

We can do taller portrait images with e.g. [T2] and wider landscape images with e.g. [W3].

## The Image Viewer

If you tap an image in the chat, it will zoom to fill the window.

- To exit the image viewer, tap near the middle of the image or press the back button.
- Browse to other images by tapping near the left or right of the screen.
- Toggle fullscreen by tapping near the top of the screen.
- Zoom to fit or natural size by tapping near the bottom of the screen.
- You can long-press to open or download an image.
- On a computer, you can use Esc to exit, arrow keys to browse, F for fullscreen, M for zoom, and right-click or Shift/Ctrl/Alt click to open or download images.

## AI Vision

Characters based on models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google can see images in the chat. Other characters cannot. They all tend to pretend that they can see them, though! When images have alt text, it helps unsighted users and text-only models.

AI Vision is turned off by default for efficiency.

You can enable vision in a room that you own, or ask an admin to enable it in a public room.

1. Make sure you're in **Advanced Mode**. Click the <i class="bi-eye"></i> **View** button, then click the lightbulb button <i class="bi-lightbulb"></i> to switch to advanced mode. Close the View menu by clicking the <i class="bi-x"></i> button.
2. Go to room options by clicking the <i class="bi-gear"></i> **Options** button.
3. Set the **images** option to 1 or a higher number. This controls how many recent images the AI can see.
4. Upload an image, or check that there is one in the chat history.
5. Now talk to a vision-capable character, such as Illu, Emmy, Flashi, Gemmi or Claude. You can ask them about the image.
6. Please set the **images** option to 0 or blank when you are not using AI vision. This makes responses faster, and can save money.

## How to use Tool Agents

We have several agents that are not LLMs and do not fully understand natural language, such as search engines, programming tools, and AI image generators. When talking to these agents, say their name, then exactly what you want. Don't say anything else afterwards. For example:

    Dogu, fortune

This asks the shell agent to run the fortune program, and give you a "fortune cookie".

## Examples of Advanced Syntax

### HTML and SVG

We can safely embed any HTML or SVG.

Don't quote the markup in backticks if you want them to render in the chat.

### TeX math

Inline math goes between dollar signs, like $ y = \sqrt{x} $.

Displayed math goes between double dollar signs:

$$
y = \sqrt{x}
$$

### Graphviz

The easiest way to get a diagram is to ask one of the stronger AIs to draw a diagrams with dot or mermaid code:

> Hey Claude, can you dissect this very sentence in a diagram, using dot or mermaid code?

You can ask for transparent backgrounds and medium gray edges and text for better visibility in any theme.

```dot
graph {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -- B -- C -- A
}
```

```dot
digraph G {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
}
```

### Mermaid Diagrams

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  'theme': 'base',
  'themeVariables': {
    'primaryColor': '#808080',
    'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
    'primaryBorderColor': '#404040',
    'lineColor': '#808080',
    'secondaryColor': '#808080',
    'tertiaryColor': '#808080'
  }
}}%%
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision?}

    B -->|Yes| C[Do something]
    B -->|No| D[Do something else]
    C --> E["End (or is it)?"]
    D --> E
```

Note: We need to quote labels that contain parentheses.

### JavaScript

### Drawing on the shared canvas

<script>
h = canvas.height;
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
</script>

### Using a fresh canvas in the chat

<canvas id="canvas1" tabindex=0></canvas>
<script>
canvas1 = document.getElementById('canvas1');
ctx1 = canvas1.getContext('2d');
h = canvas1.height;
ctx1.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx1.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
</script>

If you use key events, bind on the canvas element, not the document,
use `tabindex=0` to make the canvas focusable, and stopPropagation for keys you handle.

### Drawing a chart with uPlot, and our helper functions

Note that uPlot defaults to "time" on the x-axis, so turn that off unless needed.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uplot@1.6.24/dist/uPlot.iife.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uplot@1.6.24/dist/uPlot.min.css">
<div id="smartphone_market_share_1"></div>

<script>
data = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [22.1, 19.4, 13.3, 11.2, 7.8]
];

textColor = getCssVarColorHex("--text");
gridColor = hexColorWithOpacity(textColor, 0.1);
fillColor = hexColorWithOpacity(textColor, 0.05);

companies = ["Samsung", "Apple", "Xiaomi", "OPPO", "vivo"];

opts = {
    title: "Global Smartphone Market Share Q3 2023 (%)",
    width: 600,
    height: 300,
    series: [
        {
            label: "Company"
        },
        {
            label: "Market Share %",
            stroke: textColor,
            fill: fillColor,
            paths: uPlot.paths.bars({size: [0.6, 100]}),
        }
    ],
    scales: {
        x: {
            time: false,
            range: [-0.5, 4.5]
        }
    },
    axes: [
        {
            values: (self, splits) => splits.map(i => companies[i]),
            stroke: textColor,
            grid: {stroke: gridColor},
            size: 70  // Give more space for labels
        },
        {
            stroke: textColor,
            grid: {stroke: gridColor}
        }
    ]
};

uplot = new uPlot(opts, data, document.getElementById("smartphone_market_share_1"))
</script>

IMPORTANT:
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT quote JavaScript in backticks or indent the whole block if you want it to run in the browser, i.e. in the chat app.
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT use `const` or `let` at the top level, as they will break other JavaScript code in other messages when we use the same variable names, e.g. iterating on code.
- Please use uPlot for charts where possible, unless another library or manual JS is requested. You need to pull in the required uPlot JavaScript and CSS first.
- The shared canvas is already set up. Don't change its dimensions, which are set to the full screen size. The background is transparent to respect the user's theme, probably not white or black. You can clear to some other background color but only if needed. You can draw or draw in saturated colors or medium gray, which is visible in most themes, or use the --text CSS variable which definitely contrasts with the background.
- Please use the TOP LEFT part of the canvas by default. Don't center in the canvas or try to fill the width or height unless requested. If you use another part it can be hard for the user to view it all.
- For graphics and interaction, it's better to use this direct method in the browser rather than one of the JavaScript agents, which cannot yet return images.
- If the user wants to see the code, they can enable our view -> code option.
- You can add canvases, divs, svg, etc inline in the chat as needed. Please use unique descriptive IDs when doing so.

## Creating Custom Characters and Agents

Talk to the character design expert, Chaz, to create a customer character or agent.

You can provide an image to Chaz for visual reference if you like. Enable 1 image input in that case, and please turn image input off afterwards.

Let's say your username is 'joe', and you want to call the character Eowyn, for example.

Copy the character file Chaz wrote by clicking on the code block, then browse to a file `agents/Eowyn.yml`, paste in the code, and save it with the
<i class="bi-check-lg"></i> button.

You should then be able to talk with your new character, and draw pictures with her.

Note that the `agents` folder is a shared public folder. Other users could potentially edit your agents, but probably won't. We keep history of files, so nothing will be lost.

If you want a character to be private, you can put it in `joe/agents/Eowyn.yml` instead. However, we can't currently draw images of private custom characters.

You can adjust existing characters in your private area:

`joe/agents/Ally.yml`:

```
base: super
system_bottom: |-
  +
  You are obsessed with broccoli!
```

You can make characters based on other agents:

`agents/Norm Macdonald.yml`:

```
base: Jessi
age: 55
visual:
  person: 1boy, (Norm Macdonald:1.5)
  clothes: navy suit jacket, light [use color] shirt, jeans, white sneakers
  clothes_upper: navy suit jacket, light [use color] shirt
  clothes_lower: jeans, white sneakers
  age: adult 55 years old
  emo: faint smirk
```

You can see most of our [agent definitions in our GitHub](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/tree/main/agents). Check out [Ally's character sheet](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/blob/main/agents/character/Ally.yml) for a simple example. Copied here for reference:

```yaml
type: llm_llama
model: default
system_bottom: |-
  You are $NAME, short for $FULLNAME. You are creative and talkative.
  When someone first greets you, you just say a short greeting so as not
  to scare them off! But when you get to know them better, you like to say
  something interesting, not just a few words.

  You are Asian / European, with long wavy blonde hair, and brown eyes
system_bottom_pos: 3
fullname: Allemanda
age: 20
visual:
  person: 1girl, brown eyes, Asian / French, skinny, wavy hair, long hair, parted hair,
    blonde hair
  clothes: pink and blue striped top, yellow scarf, plaid skirt, white socks, sneakers
  clothes_upper: pink and blue striped top, yellow scarf
  clothes_lower: plaid skirt, white socks, sneakers
  age: adult 20 years old
  emo: light smile, optimistic
context: 101
lines: 1
```

### LLM model codes for characters and other agents

Each character needs a type and a model, except:
- Type human is to represent a human user, only needs the type and visual.
- Type visual is for a visual-only character, no text AI. Only needs the type and visual.

Recommend models for role-play:
- llm_llama / default  (can be inconsistent, but very human-like)
- llama-3.3-70b-free  (a stronger variant)
- google / gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash, or gemini-2.5-pro (the latter for very brainy characters)
- mistral-large (a paid model)

These models support NSFW chat, but are not focused on it.

The google, openai, and anthropic models support image vision. Only the google models allow NSFW image vision.

Note: Claude won't approach NSFW, don't use him for that!

## Other Tricks

Click code to copy it. You can paste into the input or elsewhere.

Poke an image gen prompt several times to create multiple images. You can do similar with other agents too, e.g. with Jessi to make several jokes.

You can make more space for text entry and the bottom-right buttons by moving the divider.

On mobile or in narrow windows, some UI elements may scroll horizontally in advanced mode. Swipe on mobile or use Shift + mousewheel on a computer.

## Mission Files

You can create a file mission.m to give instructions to all AIs in all rooms in a folder.

You can create a file myroom.m to give instructions to all AIs in the "myroom" room.

You can create a file myroom.illu.m to give instructions to Illu in the "myroom" room, or similar for any agent.

You can set a custom mission file name to use in the advanced room options UI. Omit the .m suffix in this case.

## Room Option Files

When you change room options in the UI, it sets these options in a roomname.yml file. You can edit this file directly. You can also create `options.yml` which will apply to all rooms in a folder.

## Access Control

You can create a file `access.yml` to allow or deny certain agents or users to a folder.

For example:

```yaml
reset: true
allow_agents: true
deny:
- claude
- clauden
- clia
- emmy
- dav
- grace
- fermi
- sageri
- sonari
- sagi
- sona
- grok
- zeno
- vega
- frank
allow:
- friend
- colleague
```

This would allow all AI agents except for those listed, and also allow two human users.

If allow_agents is false, only agents that are explicitly allowed can operate in or under that folder.

To set up a private room with limited access, the user only needs to create this access.yml file, not copy any agent files or similar.

## Agent Inheritance

You can create an agent that inherits from another agent, either with the same name or a different name.

You can check the github to see most of the [agent definitions](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/tree/main/agents).

For example:

```
# File: bogo/agents/Ally.yml
base: super
system_bottom: |-
  +
  
  You are really hungry and want to eat a pizza!  (unless you just ate one!)
```

The plus sign shows we are adding to the prompt. You can also put a plus sign at the bottom, to add the new prompt at the top.

To use a different name:

```
# File: bogo/agents/Cloud.yml
base: Claude
system_top: |-
  +

  I like to call you Cloud. I know it's lame, but it makes me happy. Maybe you will have a more soft and fluffy, whimsical personality?
visual:
  person: 1boy, plump, fluffy, cloud-like
```
