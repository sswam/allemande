To generate good ideas, utilize uncritical brainstorming, mind mapping, and techniques like SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, freewriting, reverse thinking, and random word association. Optimize environmental factors, incorporate physical activities, and collaborate with others. Research broadly, employ problem-solving approaches, and capture ideas effectively. Allow for incubation, use structured techniques, and leverage creative triggers. Manage time efficiently, evaluate ideas, and plan for implementation. Remember to combine existing concepts, learn from failures, and practice regularly.
