# Ally Chat is inclusive: a good choice for women, LGBTQIA+, and speakers of any language

Ally Chat is our free to use AI group chat app. You can chat in private, or together with several AIs and other users. Please check out our subreddits at r/AllyChat and r/AllyChatX (NSFW).

We include 50+ AI models, with all the major LLMs, uncensored options like Llama 3, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Venice, and numerous AI art models with strong support for NSFW image gen.

Ally Chat supports male, female, and non-binary users, and all orientations. We love diversity. This isn't just an AI girlfriend app, it can be a queer AI polyamory app, or whatever you want it to be.

I'll be honest: as of now, most users are male. A big surprise to nobody! But we are trying hard to make the app useful, enjoyable, safe and comfortable for women and the LGBTQIA+ community. We are friendly, light-hearted, not judgemental, and take a dim view of intolerance, bigotry, or bullying of any kind.

Being honest again: we want to be inclusive, but we likely won't censor things that you dislike. You can choose where to chat, and what sort of content you'd like to engage with or avoid. Enjoying full freedom within the law is fundamental to Ally Chat, and role-play is distinct from reality.

We have a diverse user base, and welcome people from all countries and cultures. We support chat in any language, including right-to-left languages. We have translation agents to help users communicate across cultures. We can translate the user guide for you into any language on request.

Our AI characters are rich and varied, and it's easy for users to add new characters too. Our number one character, Ally, is mixed race.

All of the AI models we use, even the notorious Grok (!), are friendly and reasonable with diversity. Some of the art models are biased (e.g. they tend to draw slender white females by default); but they are very capable, and we can help work around any issues.

We don't limit what kinks are allowed. Kink shaming is off the menu!

Most of our 1500+ characters are not prompted to be sexual in any way. Nevertheless, they have sexual feelings (or role-play them), and most are enthusiastic to explore.

We want to make further improvements around inclusivity and diversity, so please let us know if you have any complaints, suggestions, or good ideas in this area.

And yes, we can draw five somewhat consistent characters standing together in the same image. Sometimes, when it works! Don't look too closely at their toes.
