# Quick Intro

Welcome to Ally Chat, the multi-player AI chat app.

Ally Chat is open source and free to use.

You can talk with top AI models from different providers, and realistic AI characters too.

You can have group chats with several AIs together, and with other people.

Free users have access to all models and features, but there are some good perks for supporters too.

If you'd like to support us, you can [become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/allychat).

## Getting Started

Read this intro carefully!

Click the <i class="bi-question-lg"></i> help button, and talk with Flashi in the *Help* tab. In this help system, AIs can give extensive help based on the full user guide.

In the main [Ally Chat](/Ally+Chat) room, AIs can help with basic info about the app.

**NOTE**: In other chat rooms, AIs don't know anything at all about the app!

Read this [Quick Intro](/intro), then the [User Guide](/guide), for full details on the app, models, characters, and tools.

The app has an advanced mode with many options and features, but please master the basics first.

Please contact Sam, the main developer, for more help and to give feedback.

## Talking with AIs

Address AIs by name to get their attention:

> Ally, how are you?
> Can you help, Flashi?
> Illu, let's draw a garden!

Send an empty "poke" message to continue AI conversations. You'll need to do this after Illu writes an AI art prompt for you.

You can say @anyone for a random AI, or @everyone for several responses.
