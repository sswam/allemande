# Quick Intro to Ally Chat

Ally Chat is a multi-user chat platform with access to numerous AI models. It's open source, free to use, and lets you chat with multiple AIs and humans together.

## Getting Started

1. **Getting Help**
- In the main public [Ally Chat](/Ally Chat) room, AIs can help with some basic info about the app.
- Note that in other chat rooms, the AIs don't know anything at all about the app.
- Click the `i` help button and talk to Flashi. In the help system, Flashi has access to the full user guide and can give very detailed help.
- You can talk with Sam, the main developer, and other users.
- Read this [Quick Intro](/intro), or the [User Guide](/guide) for full details on the app, models, characters, and tools.
- The advanced mode of the app has many options and features, you can try that when you've mastered the basics.

2. **Talking with AIs**
- You can address AIs by name:
  - "Ally, how are you?"
  - "Can you help, Flashi?"
  - "@Illu, let's draw a garden!"
- Send an empty "poke" message to continue AI conversations. You'll need to do this after Illu writes an AI art prompt for you.
