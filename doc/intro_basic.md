# Ally Chat - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Help

For help learning the app, talk to Flashi, Claude or Emmy first - they're excellent guides!

For making images, talk to Illu or Gema - they are image generation experts.

## How to Talk with AIs

1. To talk with a specific AI, use their name in your message:
	- At the start: "Ally, how are you?"
	- At the end: "Can you help me learn to use the app, Flashi?"
	- Using @: "@Illu, I want to draw a camel!"

2. Sometimes you need to "poke" the chat to get the AI next response.

Example of image generation:

> You: Illu, I'd like to draw a rainbow.
>
> Illu: <details><summary>Thinking</summary> ... </details>
>
> Illy, landscape, grassland, mountains, (vibrant rainbow:1.5), (majestic mountains:1.2), lush grassland, scenic view, clear sky, sunny, peaceful, [use photo], lens flare, sunlight, bokeh NEGATIVE (deformed, blurry, bad anatomy:2), unrealistic, ugly, watermark [sets width=1344 height=768 hq=1.5 steps=30]
>
> ***[you press poke here]***
>
> Illy: [generates image]

Remember:

- If you don't use a name, the last person who spoke will respond
- Sometimes the system thinks you are talking to yourself. Try mentioning an AI's name.
- Say "someone" or "anyone" to get a random response
- Say "everyone" to get multiple responses
