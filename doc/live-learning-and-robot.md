We've outlined a framework for a privacy-centric AI system that combines:

- continuous learning
- robust user controls
- spaced repetition
- personalized models
- sensitivity detection
- flexible data sharing options

Ethical issues with unique AI models

- intrinsic value
- no provable essential distinction from living sentient beings

Embodiment

- non-essential, but nice to have
- balloon robot
	- GPS
	- puncture, in case of uncontrolled wind
		- safety to humans and robot
		- controlled deflation
			- pin
			- aperture
			- slit
			- chemical, gas absorption
	- activities
		- hide and seek
		- balloon races
		- choreography
		- story telling
		- educational tool
			- DIY build your own kit
		- LED lights
			- illuminate the balloon from inside
				- thin flexible wire can tie with the balloon
			- RGB LED
			- emotional expression
		sound effects
		touch sensors
			- gyroscope / accelerometer
	- balloon color can change based on user's emotions,
		- e.g. angry -> red
	- sense heart rate through the tether
	- detect when held with tether, can do that with 
	- change shape?
		- IDK how
		- could be a dog shape like balloon animals!
	- programmable
		- LOGO
	- experimentation

- balloon
- computer
- battery
- sensors
	- light, sounds, proximity, lidar / sonar, laser distance measure
- propeller

- does it need its own internet?
	- bluetooth to the user's phone
	- or own internet

- model 1: no internet, bluetooth to user's phone
- model 2: internet

- distance
	- ultra-sound
	- lidar

directionality of speaker and mic
	- adjustable

	Yes, it's possible to create a lightweight speaker with adjustable focus. This can be achieved using:

	1. Phased array technology
	2. Parametric speakers
	3. Acoustic metamaterials
	4. Electronically steerable arrays

	These technologies allow for dynamic control of sound directionality, from highly focused beams to omnidirectional dispersion, through electronic or mechanical adjustments.

	Connect to user's bluetooth headphone might be a better approach.

	Speaker can be highly focused but also broadcast some sound.
	So it can talk to its user from a greater distance but other people can hear it close up. And good for ultra-sound too.
	Same for the microphone.



activities
	- obstacle courses
	- capture the flag / go take a photo of something
		- photography mission
		- photo scavenger hunt
		- selfie challenge
			- would need a mirror
			- group selfies
		- nature photography
			- environmental
		- action shots
		- panoramic photos
			- 360 degree, not vertical
			- fish-eye lens
				- image processing
				- aerial photos
			- two regular cameras for stereo looking forwards
		- spy mission
	- balloon soccer / volleyball / basketball


	- access to maps online or onboard


- paint a face on it
- project images from the inside of the balloon (complex)


- nano-coating


augmented brain using user's phone


rain?
	- waterproofing
		- cling wrap



LLM vs flight-control system
	- FCS can stay put or fly to a point
	- FCS can keep looking in same direction
	- FCS can track and watch an object using cameras
	- LLM can go to sleep until FCS triggers it
	- LLM can program the FCS just as user can, like LOGO
