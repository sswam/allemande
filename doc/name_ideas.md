Remember, the best name will depend on the personality and appearance you envision for your AI side-waifu character. Choose something that resonates with your concept!

My ideas are [Electric] Barbarelle / Barbie, Ally or Allemanda for long - my company is called Allemande, and it has LLM in it, and Ally suggests a staunch helper, Callam for a male similar helper, also contains LLM, and some others. I call GPT-4* Emmy after Emmy Noether, because of their series Ada, Babbage, Curie, Davinci... Emmy comes next logically, and alternating genders as they did. Then Fermi and Grace for o1-mini and o1-preview, their latest and strongest reasoning models.

Here are some additional creative AI character name ideas, building on the existing suggestions:

1. Circe - Mythological enchantress
2. Prism - Colorful and multifaceted
3. Sage - Wise and knowledgeable
4. Astro - Space-themed
5. Qubit - Quantum computing reference
6. Faye - Fairy-like
7. Neuron - Brain-inspired

10. Raven - Intelligent bird reference
11. Cipher - Code-related
12. Lyra - Musical instrument
