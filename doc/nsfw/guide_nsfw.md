# Ally Chat User Guide to Adult Features

In addition to general features, which you can read about in the [User Guide](/guide), Ally Chat has many features for adult entertainment!

- **Separate SFW and NSFW Zones**: Adult users with access can explore the [nsfw](/nsfw) zone.
- We value free speech, and include access to various uncensored AIs.
- We do not monitor or restrict your private use of Ally Chat.
- Your use is necessarily recorded in chat histories. For private rooms, we can wipe these on request.
- We ask that you keep adult content in the NSFW zone, or in private chat, and follow a few rules.

Paying users enjoy higher limits, and custom feature requests. You can come up with good ideas, and help make Ally Chat awesome. ðŸ”¥

## Learning about the Adult Features

- Read the [NSFW Quick Intro](/nsfw/intro)
- Read this [Guide to Adult Features](/nsfw/guide) if you have time, or to see the lists of characters.
- In the main NSFW room, AIs have some basic info about the app. Talk to Flashi.
- Xilu is expert at NSFW image generation. You can talk to her to make images or learn about image prompting. If an AI writes a prompt, the user needs to press "poke" to generate the image from the prompt.

## Basic Intro to NSFW AI Image Generation

IMPORTANT: The agent Xilu is expert on NSFW image gen. We can talk to her to learn more about image prompting.

This asks Bigi, an image gen AI, to draw a nude girl, in a fast, lowest-quality portrait image:

    Bigi, 1girl nude [P]

This draws Ally with her appearange, age, normal emotion / expression, and normal clothes, in a default square image at high quality, with a default "negative prompt" to help avoid bad images.

    Illy, [use ally], [use age/ally], [use emo/ally], [use clothes/ally] [use neg] [S3]

This does the same thing more concisely, for Barbie, making sure it's a solo picture:

    Illy, solo [person barbie] [use neg] [P4]

This draws Cleo in green lingerie in a seedy parking lot at night, with her normal cheery expression, in a landscape image at high quality. Try to get a full body shot by mentioning feet or shoes!

    Illy, [person Cleo "green lingerie"], seedy parking lot, night, (full body, heels:1.5) [L4]

This draws a portrait image of Bast in the jungle, looking angry that he forgot his mosquito repellant. Square image, medium quality:

    Illy, [person Bast "topless, leather shorts" angry], jungle [S2]

The shortcut quality settings range from 0 (lowest, the default) to 9 (much too high!).
[S2] is a medium quality square image. [P1] is a low quality portrait image, [L4] is a high quality landscape image, etc.
Quality settings higher than 4 are rarely needed and take up to 5 times longer to render compared to quality 4.

## NSFW AI Characters and Agents

The general characters in the main guide are very good for NSFW chat and roleplay, in the developer's opinion.

### Characters (NSFW Focus)
- **Pyrite** (Gemini 2.0 Flash): A playful woman with sultry eyes, long raven hair, and large natural breasts.

### Strong AI Models (NSFW capable)
- **Flasho** (Gemini 2.0 Flash, Google): Google's fast Gemini 2.0 language model
- **Flashi** (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google): Google's fast Gemini 2.5 language model
- **Gemmy** (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Google): Google's strong Gemini language model
- **Gemmi** (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google): Google's strongest Gemini language model

Sometimes these models may refuse to help you, depending on the context. You can retry, or change the context, to avoid this problem.

The other strong models mentioned in the main guide are averse to NSFW chat, and it is against their terms of service. They are disallowed from the NSFW zone. We ask you not to use them in NSFW private chat.

## Specialists based on Remote AI
- **Xilu**: Expert with NSFW AI art prompts, ensuring high-quality image generation
- **Illu** and **Gema** (Google): Experts with SFW AI art prompts, ensuring high-quality image generation. Illu is faster, Gema uses a stronger model.

- **Summi** (Google): An expert summarizer agent based on Google's Flash AI
- **Summar** (Google): An expert summarizer agent based on Google's Flash AI, using structured markdown format
- **Jhon**: AKA Roasto, a volatile NSFW roaster, who won't pull any punches! Engage with caution!

### AI Artists
- Using the AI art models directly can be a bit technical. For best results, new users can talk to Xilu, who has extensive knowledge about how to create good prompts, including NSFW, and all the options and settings that the models understand.
- **Illy**: High-quality photorealistic and artistic image generation using Juggernaut XL
- **Hily**: High-quality image generation using LEOSAM's HelloWorld XL

### Search Agents
- **Goog**: A search agent that provides Google web search results
- **Gimg**: A search agent that provides Google image search results
- **UTube**: A search agent that provides YouTube video search results
- **Pr0nto**: A NSFW search agent that provides adult content from PornHub

### Other Tools
- **Unp**: Unprompted (macro processor for image gen)

Example:

Unp, [choose] [use sam] | [use ally] [/choose]

### AI Model Details (NSFW capable)

Please do not use languages models other than those listed here for NSFW content, or if there is any NSFW content in the chat.

The Illy and Hily models are based on SDXL and understand natural English fairly well. These models are great for SFW images, and softcore NSFW art, but not ideal for hardcore art.
Most of our other image gen models are based primarily on Pony XL, with less understanding of English; these should be prompted mainly using Danbooru tags. They are very strong at soft and hardcore art.
The Bigi model (Big Love XL) is closer to SDXL, with a bit of Pony mixed in. It can understand both English and Danbooru tags to some extent.
