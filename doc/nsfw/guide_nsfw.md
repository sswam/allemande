## Learning about the Adult Features

- Read the [NSFW Quick Intro](/nsfw/intro)
- Read this [Guide to Adult Features](/nsfw/guide) if you have time, or to see the lists of characters.
- In the main NSFW room, AIs have some basic info about the app. Talk to Flashi.
- Xilu is expert at NSFW image generation. You can talk to her to make images or learn about image prompting. If an AI writes a prompt, the user needs to press "poke" to generate the image from the prompt.

## Basic Intro to NSFW AI Image Generation

IMPORTANT: The agent Xilu is expert on NSFW image gen. We can talk to her to learn more about image prompting.

This asks Bigi, an image gen AI, to draw a nude girl, in a fast, lowest-quality portrait image:

    Bigi, 1girl nude [P]

This draws Ally with her appearange, age, normal emotion / expression, and normal clothes, in a default square image at high quality, with a default "negative prompt" to help avoid bad images.

    Illy, [use ally], [use age/ally], [use emo/ally], [use clothes/ally] [use neg] [S3]

This does the same thing more concisely, for Barbie, making sure it's a solo picture:

    Illy, solo [person barbie] [use neg] [P4]

This draws Cleo in green lingerie in a seedy parking lot at night, with her normal cheery expression, in a landscape image at high quality. Try to get a full body shot by mentioning feet or shoes!

    Illy, [person Cleo "green lingerie"], seedy parking lot, night, (full body, heels:1.5) [L4]

This draws a portrait image of Bast in the jungle, looking angry that he forgot his mosquito repellant. Square image, medium quality:

    Illy, [person Bast "topless, leather shorts" angry], jungle [S2]

The shortcut quality settings range from 0 (lowest, the default) to 9 (much too high!).
[S2] is a medium quality square image. [P1] is a low quality portrait image, [L4] is a high quality landscape image, etc.
Quality settings higher than 4 are rarely needed and take up to 5 times longer to render compared to quality 4.

### AI Model Details (NSFW capable)

Please do not use languages models other than those listed here for NSFW content, or if there is any NSFW content in the chat.

The Illy and Hily models are based on SDXL and understand natural English fairly well. These models are great for SFW images, and softcore NSFW art, but not ideal for hardcore art.
Most of our other image gen models are based primarily on Pony XL, with less understanding of English; these should be prompted mainly using Danbooru tags. They are very strong at soft and hardcore art.
The Bigi model (Big Love XL) is closer to SDXL, with a bit of Pony mixed in. It can understand both English and Danbooru tags to some extent.
