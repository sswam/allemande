**Areas for Improvement (Suggestions):**

*   **Target Audience Awareness:** Assume users have no experience with this before. Define terms like "LLM," "LoRA," "Danbooru tags," "Negative Prompt," "prompt engineering."
*   **Image Generation Troubleshooting:**  Include common problems and solutions.  For example:
    *   "If images are blurry, try increasing the quality setting ([S3], [L4], etc.)."
    *   "If you're getting unexpected results, double-check your spelling and the tags you're using."
    *   "If faces are too similar when using PonyXL-based models, try adding `(diverse faces)` to your prompt."
*   **Emphasize LoRA Usage** You don't mention LoRAs much. LoRAs for NSFW content are super helpful, but not mentioned in the document. LoRAs are not as important as characters and image gen instructions though.
*   **Clarify "Uncensored":**  The term "uncensored" needs to be qualified.  It doesn't mean anything goes.  Refer back to the "Rules" section consistently. Consider using terms like "less restricted" or "allows for explicit content" instead.
*   **Simplify Initial Image Generation Examples:**  The examples are a little dense for a complete beginner.  Start with the *most basic* possible prompt, then build upon it.
*   **NSFW Vision Warnings:** Provide a disclaimer like "AI Vision is new technology, use with caution, and not available in all models."

**Specific Edits/Additions (optional):**

*   **Add to Intro:  "Ally Chat provides an environment for adult-oriented interaction and content generation.  This guide assumes you are familiar with the basic functionality of the platform, as outlined in the [User Guide](/guide).  The following sections describe features specific to NSFW content and responsible use."**
*   **In the Rules section, explicitly state:** "Failure to adhere to these rules may result in account suspension and potential legal action."
*   **In Basic Intro to NSFW AI Image Generation, define "negative prompt":**  "A *negative prompt* is a list of things you *don't* want in the image.  This helps the AI avoid unwanted artifacts or results."
*   **Explain [use person X]**  for image gen.

**Overall:**

This guide is excellent and provides a comprehensive introduction to the adult features of Ally Chat.  By addressing the suggested improvements, you can make it even more accessible and user-friendly for newcomers to the platform.  The level of detail is impressive, particularly regarding the AI model specifications.
