# Quick Intro (NSFW)

Welcome to Ally Chat, the multi-player AI chat app.

Ally Chat is open source and free to use.

You can talk with top AI models from different providers, and realistic AI characters too.

You can have group chats with several AIs together, and with other people.

We believe in privacy and free speech, and oppose censorship.

The app includes models and features for adult entertainment, and is good for other things too.

The NSFW zone contains explicit sexual material, and is restricted to adults only.

Free users have access to all models and features, but there are some good perks for supporters too.

If you'd like to support us, you can [become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/allychat).

## Getting Started

Read this intro carefully!

Click the <i class="bi-question-lg"></i> help button at the top right, and talk with your assistant in the **Help** tab. In this help system, AIs can give extensive help based on the full user guide.

In the main [Ally Chat](/Ally+Chat) room and the main [NSFW Chat](/nsfw/nsfw) room, AIs can help with basic info about the app.

**NOTE**: In other chat rooms, AIs don't know anything at all about the app!

Read the [Quick Intro](/intro), then the [User Guide](/guide), for full details on the app, models, characters, and tools.

Read this [NSFW Intro](/nsfw/intro), then the [User Guide to Adult Features](/nsfw/guide) for more info about adult features, models, characters, and tools.

A red dot at the top-right means you are disconnected or offline. Reload the page.

The app has an advanced mode with many options and features, but please master the basics first.

Please contact Sam, the main developer, for more help and to give feedback.

## Talking with AIs

Address AIs by name to get their attention, with a capital letter or @ sign:

> hey Ally, you're looking hot!
> Can you help run a sexy photoshoot, @flashi?
> Xilu, draw a nude girl!
> Do you know any brunettes who might be up for sexy role-play, Yenta?

Send an empty "poke" message to continue AI conversations. You'll need to do this after Xilu writes an AI art prompt for you.

You can say @anyone for a random AI, or @everyone for several responses.
