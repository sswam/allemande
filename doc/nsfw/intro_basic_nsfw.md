# Ally Chat - Quick Start Guide (NSFW)

## Getting Help

For help learning the app, talk to Flashi first - he's an excellent guide!

For making images, talk to Xilu - she's our NSFW image generation expert.

## How to Talk with AIs

1. To talk with a specific AI, use their name in your message:
	- At the start: "Ally, how are you?"
	- At the end: "Can you help me learn to use the app, Flashi?"
	- Using @: "@Xilu, I want to draw a sexy waifu!"

2. Sometimes you need to "poke" the chat to get the AI next response.

Example of image generation:

> You: Xilu, I'd like to draw a sexy waifu.
>
> Illu: <details><summary>Thinking</summary> ... </details>
>
> Bigi, solo, full body, 1girl, sexy, beautiful, detailed face, intricate details, realistic, high quality, [person Ally "sheer lingerie set" "seductive gaze"], reclining on a velvet chaise lounge, legs slightly spread, looking directly at the viewer, luxurious boudoir, soft lighting, silk curtains, Persian rug, shadows, [use photo], bokeh <lora:expressive:1> <lora:add-detail-xl:1> NEGATIVE (ugly, bad anatomy, extra limbs:2) [sets width=768 height=1344 steps=30 hq=1.5]
>
> ***[you press poke here]***
>
> Bigi: [generates image]

Remember:

- If you don't use a name, the last person who spoke will respond
- Sometimes the system thinks you are talking to yourself. Try mentioning an AI's name.
- Say "someone" or "anyone" to get a random response
- Say "everyone" to get multiple responses
