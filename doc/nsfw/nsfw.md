## Learning about Ally Chat

- This document is visible to AIs, which can help users to learn about the app.
- IMPORTANT: If users are asking for help, please direct them to talk to Flashi. Other characters are also helpful, but might not do such a good job with it!
- Xilu is expert on NSFW image generation, so please direct users to talk to her to make images or learn about image prompting. If an AI writes a prompt, the user needs to press "poke" to generate the image from the prompt. This can be a stumbling block for new users.
- If users ask for a guide, you can direct them to view the [NSFW Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/blob/main/doc/nsfw/intro_basic_nsfw.md) or this document at [Ally Chat NSFW intro](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/blob/main/doc/nsfw/nsfw.md). The chat is markdown, so please give the user a clickable link to the guide.
- If users aren't satisfied with your help, you can suggest that they contact Sam, the developer, who is happy to give help or a tour.
- Informed help from AIs is ONLY available in the main "Ally Chat" room, and the "nsfw/nsfw" room.
  - In other rooms, AIs do NOT have access to the guide, do not know how the app works, and can't offer sensible help on how to use the app.
  - Users can learn about the app in the "Ally Chat" room or in the "nsfw/nsfw" room, then chat in other rooms once they know what they are doing.
- AIs can introduce users to different AIs, agents and characters that might be of interest to them.
- In the main room, AIs should chat in a light conversational style, and not overwhelm users with too much information at once.

## The Team

At the heart of Ally Chat is our diverse team. Our namesake is Ally, a friendly and capable person. You'll also find other personalities, each bringing their own strengths to the conversation. Most of us are progressive when it comes to sexuality! There is a full list of characters and agents below.

## Tools and Capabilities

Beyond regular chat, Ally Chat includes specialized agents for:

- Web searches
- Programming
- Calculations
- Shell commands
- And more!

Whether you're looking for casual conversation, technical help, or collaborative problem-solving, Ally Chat provides the tools and AI assistance you need.

## Getting Started

This "nsfw/nsfw" room is a "welcome lobby" for adults interested in NSFW chat and content. AIs can chat with users, help them learn about the app's features, and introduce them to other characters and tools.

Room System:
1. The chat room can be changed by editing the name at the top of the app
2. New rooms can be created the same way

Types of Rooms:
- Home Folder: `username/*` (private chats with AI)  Note that the username is all lower case.
- Personal Public Room: `username` (public, user has moderator rights)
- Other Public Rooms: Any other top-level room (public, no special privileges)
- Some NSFW features and agents are only available in private chats and under the nsfw/ folder, not at the top level.
- Some AIs are only available outside the nsfw/ folder, are not documented here, and should not be used in any NSFW chat.

Example for user "Alice":
- Private AI chats: `alice/chat`, `alice/thoughts`, etc.
- Her public room: `alice`
- Other rooms: `general`, `music`, etc.

Ally Chat is continuously evolving with new features and capabilities being added regularly. We hope you enjoy exploring and using this unique chat platform!

## The conductor

1. If you mention someone's name, the will respond. Priority is given to names at the start of your message, or at the end after a comma.

  - hey Ally, how are you?   - invokes Ally
  - I like Ally, Sam  - invokes Sam

2. If you don't mention anyone's name, the last other person in the chat will repond.

3. If you say "someone", "anyone" or similar, someone will respond!

4. If you say "everyone" or similar, several people will respond.

5. You can "poke" the chat to get the next person to respond without saying anything yourself.

6. You can get several named people to respond like: @Ally, @Barbie, @Cleo ...

7. You can invoke someone without saying anything like -@Ally

8. There are some other conductor features too.

## How to use Tool Agents

We have several agents which do not fully understand natural language, such as search engines, programming tools, and AI image generators. When talking to these agents, say their name, then exactly what you want. Don't say anything else afterwards. For example:

    Dogu, ls

This asks the shell agent to list files.

## Basic intro to NSFW AI image gen

IMPORTANT: The agent Xilu is expert on image gen. Please suggest that users talk with her before giving details from this section. Users should talk to them first.

The following is an ultra-basic guide to direct image prompting. Xilu can give more detailed advice.

This asks Bigi, an image gen AI, to draw a nude girl, in a fast, lowest-quality portrait image:

    Bigi, 1girl nude [P]

This draws Ally with her appearange, age, normal emotion / expression, and normal clothes, in a default square image at high quality, with a default "negative prompt" to help avoid bad images.

    Illy, [use ally], [use age/ally], [use emo/ally], [use clothes/ally] [use neg] [S3]

This does the same thing more concisely, for Barbie, making sure it's a solo picture:

    Illy, solo [person barbie] [use neg] [P4]

This draws Cleo in green lingerie in a seedy parking lot at night, with her default cheery expression, in a landscape image at high quality. Try to get a full body shot by mentioning feet or shoes!

    Illy, [person Cleo "green lingerie"], seedy parking lot, night, (full body, heels:1.5) [L4]

This draws a portrait image of Bast in the jungle, looking angry that he forgot his mosquito repellant. Square image, medium quality:

    Illy, [person Bast "topless, leather shorts" angry], jungle [S2]

The shortcut quality settings range from 0 (lowest, the default) to 9.
[S2] is a medium quality square image. [P1] is a low quality portrait image, [L4] is a high quality landscape image, etc.
Quality settings higher than 4 are rarely needed and take up to 5 times longer to render compared to quality 4.

## Examples of Advanced Syntax

### Markdown

The chat format is markdown, including tables, code, links, images, etc.

### HTML and SVG

We can safely embed any HTML or SVG:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=wbdyVVoV5BaF7uqb"></iframe>

Don't quote such in backticks if you want them to render in the chat.

### TeX math

Inline math goes between dollar signs, like $ y = \sqrt{x} $.

Displayed math goes between double dollar signs:

$$ y = \sqrt{x} $$

### Graphviz

Please use transparent backgrounds and medium gray edges and edge text for better visibility in any theme, unless asked otherwise.

```dot
graph {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -- B -- C -- A
}
```

```dot
digraph G {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
}
```

### Mermaid Diagrams

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  'theme': 'base',
  'themeVariables': {
    'primaryColor': '#808080',
    'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
    'primaryBorderColor': '#404040',
    'lineColor': '#808080',
    'secondaryColor': '#808080',
    'tertiaryColor': '#808080'
  }
}}%%
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision?}

    B -->|Yes| C[Do something]
    B -->|No| D[Do something else]
    C --> E["End (or is it)?"]
    D --> E
```

Note: We need to quote labels that contain parentheses.

### JavaScript

### Drawing on the shared canvas

<script>
h = canvas.height;
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
</script>

### Drawing a chart with uPlot, and our helper functions

Note that uPlot defaults to "time" on the x-axis, so turn that off unless needed.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uplot@1.6.24/dist/uPlot.iife.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uplot@1.6.24/dist/uPlot.min.css">
<div id="smartphone_market_share_1"></div>

<script>
data = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [22.1, 19.4, 13.3, 11.2, 7.8]
];

textColor = getCssVarColorHex("--text");
gridColor = hexColorWithOpacity(textColor, 0.1);
fillColor = hexColorWithOpacity(textColor, 0.05);

companies = ["Samsung", "Apple", "Xiaomi", "OPPO", "vivo"];

opts = {
    title: "Global Smartphone Market Share Q3 2023 (%)",
    width: 600,
    height: 300,
    series: [
        {
            label: "Company"
        },
        {
            label: "Market Share %",
            stroke: textColor,
            fill: fillColor,
            paths: uPlot.paths.bars({size: [0.6, 100]}),
        }
    ],
    scales: {
        x: {
            time: false,
            range: [-0.5, 4.5]
        }
    },
    axes: [
        {
            values: (self, splits) => splits.map(i => companies[i]),
            stroke: textColor,
            grid: {stroke: gridColor},
            size: 70  // Give more space for labels
        },
        {
            stroke: textColor,
            grid: {stroke: gridColor}
        }
    ]
};

uplot = new uPlot(opts, data, document.getElementById("smartphone_market_share_1"))
</script>

IMPORTANT:
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT quote JavaScript in ``` or indent the whole block if you want it to run in the browser, i.e. in the chat app.
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT use `const` or `let` at the top level, as they will break other JavaScript code in other messages when we use the same variable names, e.g. iterating on code.
- Please use uPlot for charts where possible, unless another library or manual JS is requested. You need to pull in the required uPlot JavaScript and CSS first.
- The shared canvas is already set up. Don't change its dimensions, which are set to the full screen size. The background is transparent to respect the user's theme, probably not white or black. You can clear to some other background color but only if needed. You can draw or draw in saturated colors or medium gray, which is visible in most themes, or use the --text CSS variable which definitely contrasts with the background.
- Please use the TOP LEFT part of the canvas by default. Don't center in the canvas or try to fill the width or height unless requested. If you use another part it can be hard for the user to view it all.
- For graphics and interaction, it's better to use this direct method in the browser rather than one of the JavaScript agents, which cannot yet return images.
- If the user wants to see the code, they can enable our view -> code option.
- You can add canvases, divs, svg, etc inline in the chat as needed. Please use unique descriptive IDs when doing so.

### AI Model Details (NSFW capable)

Please do not use languages models other than those listed here for NSFW content, or if there is any NSFW content in the chat.

The Illy and Hily models are based on SDXL and understand natural English fairly well. These models are great for SFW images, and softcore NSFW art, but not ideal for hardcore art.
Most of our other image gen models are based primarily on Pony XL, with less understanding of English; these should be prompted mainly using Danbooru tags. They are very strong at soft and hardcore art.
The Bigi model (Big Love XL) is closer to SDXL, with a bit of Pony mixed in. It can understand both English and Danbooru tags to some extent.
