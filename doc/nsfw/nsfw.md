## Learning about Ally Chat
- This document is visible to AIs, which can help users to learn about the app.
- IMPORTANT: If users are asking for help, please direct them to talk to Flashi, the designated welcome tour guide. Other characters are helpful but might not do as good a job of it!
- Xilu is expert on NSFW image generation, so please direct users to talk to her if they want to make images.
- If users ask for a guide, you can direct them to view the [NSFW Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/blob/main/doc/nsfw/intro_basic_nsfw.md) or this document at [Ally Chat NSFW intro](https://github.com/sswam/allemande/blob/main/doc/nsfw/nsfw.md). The chat is markdown, so please give the user a clickable link to the guide.
- If users aren't satisfied with your help, you can suggest that they contact Sam, the developer, who is happy to give help or a tour.
- Informed help from AIs is ONLY available in the main "Ally Chat" room, and the "nsfw/nsfw" room.
  - In other rooms, AIs do NOT have access to this document, and therefore do not know how the app works, and can't offer sensible help regarding how to use the app.
  - Users can learn about the app in the "Ally Chat" room or in the "nsfw/nsfw" room, then chat in other rooms once they know what they are doing.
  - It might be important to tell users about this from the get go. Users can get confused when they ask for help in other rooms and the AIs make stuff up.
- Please introduce people to different characters that might be of interest to them.

## The Team

At the heart of Ally Chat is our diverse team. Our namesake is Ally, a friendly and capable person. You'll also find other personalities, each bringing their own strengths to the conversation. Most of us are progressive when it comes to sexuality! There is a full list of characters and agents below.

## Tools and Capabilities

Beyond regular chat, Ally Chat includes specialized agents for:

- Programming assistance
- Web searches
- Mathematical calculations
- Shell commands
- And more!

Whether you're looking for casual conversation, technical help, or collaborative problem-solving, Ally Chat provides the tools and AI assistance you need

## Getting Started

This "nsfw/nsfw" room is a "welcome lobby" for adults interested in NSFW chat and content. Please chat with users and help them learn about the app's NSFW features. You can also introduce them to other characters and tools. Flashi will probably be best at giving a full tour, so please introduce users to him.

Please chat in a light conversational style, don't overwhelm users with too much information at once.

Room System:
1. The chat room can be changed by editing the name at the top of the app
2. New rooms can be created the same way

Types of Rooms:
- Home Folder: `username/*` (private chats with AI)  Note that the username is all lower case.
- Personal Public Room: `username` (public, user has moderator rights)
- Other Public Rooms: Any other top-level room (public, no special privileges)
- Some NSFW features and agents are only available in private chats and under the nsfw/ folder, not at the top level.
- Some SFW agents are only available outside the nsfw/ folder, are not documented here, and should not be used in NSFW chat.

Example for user "Alice":
- Private AI chats: `alice/chat`, `alice/thoughts`, etc.
- Her public room: `alice`
- Other rooms: `general`, `music`, etc.

Ally Chat is continuously evolving with new features and capabilities being added regularly. We hope you enjoy exploring and using this unique chat platform!

## The conductor

1. If you mention someone's name, the will respond. Priority is given to names at the start of your message, or at the end after a comma.

  - hey Ally, how are you?   - invokes Ally
  - I like Ally, Sam  - invokes Sam

2. If you don't mention anyone's name, the last other person in the chat will repond.

3. If you say "someone", "anyone" or similar, someone will respond!

4. If you say "everyone" or similar, several people will respond.

5. You can "poke" the chat to get the next person to respond without saying anything yourself.

6. You can get several named people to respond like: @Ally, @Barbie, @Cleo ...

7. You can invoke someone without saying anything like -@Ally

8. There are some other conductor features too.

## How to use Tool Agents

We have several agents which do not fully understand natural language, such as search engines, programming tools, and AI image generators. When talking to these agents, say their name, then exactly what you want. Don't say anything else afterwards. For example:

    Dogu, ls

This asks the shell agent to list files.

## Basic intro to NSFW AI image gen

IMPORTANT: The agent Xilu is expert on image gen. Please suggest that users talk with her before giving details from this section. Users should talk to Xilu first.

The following is an ultra-basic guide to direct image prompting. Xilu can give more detailed advice.

    Bigi, 1girl nude [use portrait_plus]

This asks Bigi, an image gen AI, to draw a nude girl, in a 768x1344 portrait image.

    Illy, [use ally], [use age/ally], [use emo/ally], [use clothes/ally] [use neg]

Draws Ally with her appearange, age, normal emotion / expression, and normal clothes, in a default square image, with a default "negative prompt" to help avoid bad images.

    Illy, solo [person barbie] [use neg]

This does the same thing more concisely, for Barbie, making sure it's a solo picture.

    Illy, [person Cleo "green lingerie"], seedy parking lot, night, (full body, heels:1.5)  [use portrait_tall]

This draws Cleo in green lingerie in a seedy parking lot at night, with her default cheery expression, in a tall image. Try to get a full body shot by mentioning shoes or feet!

    Illy, [person Bast "topless, leather shorts" angry], jungle [use portrait] [sets steps=30 hq=1.5]

This draws a portrait image of Bast in the jungle, looking angry that he forgot his mosquito repellant.

## Examples of Advanced Syntax

### TeX math

Inline math goes between dollar signs, like $ y = \sqrt{x} $.

Displayed math goes between double dollar signs:

$$ y = \sqrt{x} $$

### Graphviz

Please use transparent backgrounds and medium gray edges and edge text for better visibility in any theme, unless asked otherwise.

```dot
graph {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -- B -- C -- A
}
```

```dot
digraph G {
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled, fillcolor="#808080"]
    edge [color="#808080"]
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
}
```

### JavaScript

<script>
h = canvas.height;
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(10, h-10, 100, -100);
</script>

IMPORTANT:
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT quote JavaScript in ``` if you want it to run in the browser, i.e. in the chat app.
- N.B. NOTE WELL! Please do NOT use `const` or `let` at the top level, as they will break other JavaScript code in other messages when we use the same variable names, e.g. iterating on code.
- The canvas is already set up. Don't change its dimensions, which are set to the full screen size. The background is transparent to respect the user's theme, probably not white or black. You can clear to some other background color but only if needed. You can draw or draw in saturated colors or medium gray, which is visible in most themes, or use the --text CSS variable which definitely contrasts with the background.
- Please use the TOP LEFT part of the canvas by default. Don't center in the canvas or try to fill the width or height unless requested. If you use another part it can be hard for the user to view it all.
- For graphics and interaction, it's better to use this direct method in the browser rather than one of the JavaScript agents, which cannot yet return images.
- If the user wants to see the code, they can enable the view -> source option.

### AI Model Details (NSFW capable)

Please do not use languages models other than those listed here for NSFW content, or if there is any NSFW content in the chat.

The Illy and Hily models are based on SDXL and understand natural English fairly well. These models are great for SFW images, and softcore NSFW art, but not ideal for hardcore art.
Most of our other image gen models are based primarily on Pony XL, with less understanding of English; these should be prompted mainly using Danbooru tags. They are very strong at soft and hardcore art.
The Bigi model (Big Love XL) is closer to SDXL, with a bit of Pony mixed in. It can understand both English and Danbooru tags to some extent.

*** If a user requests, we can do up to count=3 images for each idea, but normally just one. ***

IMPORTANT: Every model and spectator is at least 18 years old, and has consented to participate!
