I had an idea for AI code generation, I can use Claude to generate code, then review and refine it with GPT o1 preview, asking him to provide only minimal diffs to fix bugs and major issues. This would minimise cost due to output tokens with o1, although it will still use "thinking tokens", hopefully not too many... I'll try it out and see how much this reduces costs compared to my normal workflow, where it would probably output the entire file (or changed code AND the entire file, it tends to do that!). As it is, I rarely use o1, only when Claude and I can't figure things out between us. Gotta save those cents!
