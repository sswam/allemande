Ally Chat is an unrestricted AI playground where you can chat, generate art, and play immersive RPGs. Check out r/AllyChat (SFW) and r/AllyChatX (NSFW).

Epic RPG engine. Run multiplayer campaigns with AI NPCs that remember your entire story arc. Quest through Middle-earth with AI Tolkien as your Game Master - just like that meme of paradise! Create AI players on the fly to join your party, or watch different AI personalities battle it out. Build persistent worlds with branching narratives and evolving characters.

Completely free to play. All 37 LLMs and 15 image models unlocked: no paywalls, no hard limits. Generate character portraits, battle scenes, and custom campaign art instantly.

Uncensored playground. NSFW content and mature themes welcome (within legal bounds, no other limits). Uncensored image models support various art styles, regional prompting, >4K resolution, and custom LoRAs. Perfect for adult campaigns. Ally Chat supports women and the queer community, not only male-gaze gooners!

Packed with features. Create group chats with multiple AI personalities, render HTML/CSS/JS in-chat, generate diagrams, code, write branching stories, or experiment with creative chaos.

Cross-platform. Progressive web app runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. Strong accessibility features, and chat in any language.

Open-source. Code is public; fork it and host your own instance if you dare!

Play-to-win, pay-what-you-feel. Support confers no real advantage, but the company is profitable and growing.

Play and chat with the developer in-app to help shape the future of interactive AI.
