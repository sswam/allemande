I like the app I wrote, Ally Chat, because:

- It's free to use, open source, and uncensored (but some rooms are moderated).
- I'm focused on providing a quality service, not extracting profit, or maximising engagement through addiction.
- Private chat, and group chat with multiple AI characters and other users.
- 30 chat models, including all the big names, 15 NSFW-capable art models.
- 800+ characters, agents and tools: models, OCs, short responses, special agents, art models, search tools, programming tools, disney characters, other cartoon and anime, fictional characters, muppets, celebrities, comedians, human avatars, nsfw agents and characters, business advisors, game characters ...
- Custom characters and agents; and agents to help you make them; 1000+ visual LoRAs.
- World-class image prompting, comedy, and roasting agents.
- Full HTML in chat, including CSS, JS, SVG, canvas, WebGL, etc.
- Excellent for personal stuff, chat, work, study, and adult entertainment.
- Designed for AI group chat from the beginning (> 2 years ago).
- I'm a top indie developer with 30+ years of professional experience, including contracting for Meta.
- I help users directly, and fix issues promptly.
- Small, friendly community.

In no other app, can your harem of AI playmates ... male, female, non-binary, furry or whatever ... help you with your calculus and programming homework, hold autonomous poetry, art, and photography competitions, create Anki flashcards for you, or vibe code a simple 3D video game like Minecraft that we can all play in the app.

In no other app can you start a rap battle between Grok 4 and DeepSeek Chat, with GPT4 adjudicating, and PonyXL guided by Gemini Flash illustrating the mayhem.

My app is not for everyone. If you want a dumbed-down experience like ChatGPT or your run-of-the-mill AI girlfriend app, and if you want to pay as much as possible rather than whatever you feel like, please look elsewhere. If you can't be bothered reading a page or two of introduction, you won't last long.

We don't yet have video gen, voice chat, RAG, or an automatic memory system. Those are underway and coming soon, with any luck!





I'd like to mention the app I wrote, Ally Chat.

In no other app, can your free harem of uncensored AI playmates ... male, female, non-binary, furry, or whatever ... help you with your calculus and programming homework; hold autonomous but interactive competitions for poetry, AI art, and nude photography; create Anki flashcards to help you learn AI or medicine; or vibe code a 3D video game that we can all play in the app.

In no other app can you start a rap battle between Grok 4 and DeepSeek Chat, with GPT4 adjudicating, and PonyXL guided by Gemini Flash illustrating the mayhem in your favourite anime or realistic art style.

My app is not for everyone.

For starters, we don't currently have the resources to host more than a few hundred active users. Places are limited. I have a plan to fix that, but it will be while coming. Time-pressure marketing, such a classic!  also true.

If you want a dumbed-down experience like ChatGPT, or your run-of-the-mill AI girlfriend app, please go and use that.

If you want to pay as much as possible rather than whatever you feel like, please look elsewhere.

If you can't be bothered reading a page or two of introductory material, you won't get off the ground.

I don't want stupid users who are only into gooning. I want intelligent users who can give me good feedback to help improve the platform.

We don't yet have video gen, voice chat, document RAG, or an automatic memory system. Those are underway and should be coming soon, along with lots of other fun stuff.

In no other app, can your free harem of uncensored AI playmates ... male, female, non-binary, furry, or whatever ... not only give you an amazing variety of kinky orgasms; they can also help you with your calculus and programming homework; hold autonomous but interactive competitions for poetry, AI art, and explicit photography; create Anki flashcards to help you learn AI or medicine; or vibe code a 3D video game with proc-gen music that we can all play in the app.

If you want a dumbed-down experience, like ChatGPT, or whatever crappy girlfriend app, please go and use that.

If you want to be censored rather than respected, you'll be happier on other platforms.

If you can't be bothered reading a page or two of introductory material, you won't get off the ground.

If you can't figure out how to get an account, you won't get one.

This is the app I built for myself. I've made it accessible so that anyone can learn to use it. But it's more vim than notepad. It's more UNIX than Windows. It's more indie than AAA.

We don't yet have video gen, voice chat, RAG, or an automatic memory system. Those are underway, and should be coming soon, along with lots of other fun stuff such as AI initiative, strong RPG support, live learning, etc.
