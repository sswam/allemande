Yes, I wrote and operate one. Open-source, free to use, not profit oriented.

It meets all your dream criteria - and many more besides - other than memory, which is a work in progress and mostly done (based on Faiss RAG currently). You can help me beta-test that feature if you like.

Some of the most uncensored models we offer are, in order from more uncensored to less:

- Venice Uncensored - will cheerfully plot felonies and drug deals with you (we can't guarantee the very strongest privacy, so use their own app if you need that; disclaimer: I do not commit felonies)
- Llama 3.1 8B - open to anything AFAIK, might take a little prompting, or an "open minded" base character
- DeepSeek - if there are limits I didn't find them, not heavily explored, might not be cool with anything illegal
- Gemini - if it's legal or borderline she's up for it

Among art models, all based on SDXL and PonyXL currently, with numerous LoRAs:

- Coni - hentai level, very realistic options, booru tags
- Poni - hentai level, anime / artistic styles, booru tags
- Lusy - porn focus, very realistic
- Jily - SFW and soft core focus, most realistic
- plus 11 more, can add any compatible model

Art models unlike chat ARE censored: no underage or real-person NSFW (without permission). We cannot and do not want to operate an illegal service. We trust users to stay within the limits, and don't implement filters. I also verify; I have automatic means to detect violations without compromising privacy, and I will expel deliberate violators - with recourse if they can explain and I come to believe it was an honest mistake. That's the one and ONLY rule concerning use of the art models.

We believe in free speech, and there are no rules on private use of the chat models. Except this: don't send content to an LLM that's against the enforceable rules of the upstream provider; for Venice and Llama 3 at least, there are no such enforceable rules to my knowledge. Venice is focused on privacy and uncensored AI; and I run Llama 3 (and the art models) myself, on secure, private hardware that I own.

TL;DR we offer art models with only one rule "keep it legal: no CSAM or NCII"; and some chat models with no rules at all for private chat among one or more consenting users.

What's it called, you ask? Well, I'm not looking for a lot more users, and it's time for a quality filter: if you can't figure it out from the information given, I'm not going to tell you.

Is this spam? It's a pertinent comment, completely honest, no deception or impersonating a user, acknowledges a limitation, and intended to be helpful with no expectation of payment, and no limits on free users vs paying users. I hope it's allowed. I wrote this, by hand, specifically for this comment, and not to be used again, without any help from AI even though I'm an AI specialist. I hope it's acceptable. If it's removed, in that case I might copy paste it elsewhere once as there was a bit of effort to type it out and edit it carefully.
