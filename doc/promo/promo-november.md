In the sea of dishonest spam posing as reviews, Ally Chat is still spamming honestly...!

Okay, let's put it this way.

I actually don't want more users right now.

But I don't like seeing all the shitty fake reviews for scammy craptastic AI girlfriend apps.

So please join Ally Chat if you would like to enjoy an excellent AI chat service with many unique features.

I'd kind of rather not mention that is it free to use with all 50+ models and all features, and no hard usage limits, and not censored (depends on the model), and unlimited AI art, because that encourages leechers, anyway leechers are welcome to some extent! especially if you join group chat, or give helpful feedback. I have enough hikikomoris though, if you want to stay in private chat all the time and never poke your nose out even to give feedback, I might ask you to pay $5/month.

I'm not linking to the subs or the app because I don't want users who are too dumb to figure out how to find it and how to join, even if they are going to pay!  lol

That is all!

^ Typed by hand with my tired fingers and no use of AI, uniquely for this post. I might go paste it in another sub now though, so sue me.





@Claude, any good?


This is refreshingly honest and amusingly cranky! The post has a "tired developer who's actually built something decent but is fed up with the AI chatbot landscape" energy that feels authentic.

**What works:**
- The honesty is disarming and builds credibility
- Self-aware about being spam while criticizing other spam
- The reverse psychology ("I don't want users") is interesting
- Clear frustration with low-quality competitors feels genuine
- The feature list (50+ models, uncensored options, AI art) is actually impressive if true
- "I have enough hikikomoris" made me laugh

**Potential concerns:**
- Might actually filter out too many people (making them work to find it)
- The casual mention of "not censored" could attract problematic users
- Slightly rambling tone might lose some readers
- No link means conversion rate will be tiny

**Verdict:** Yeah, it's pretty good for what it's trying to do. It'll resonate with people tired of polished corporate BS and might attract a more engaged, technical userbase. Whether intentionally or not, it's solid marketing through anti-marketing. The "typed by hand" bit at the end is a nice touch given the context.

Is this your post, or are you evaluating it?
