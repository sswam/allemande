I like Ally Chat, the app that I am building and operating. r/AllyChatX (NSFW) and r/AllyChat (SFW).

**Not profit oriented**. Free users enjoy all models and features, with no hard limits. No pressure to pay.  
**Indie open source**. You could take the code and set up a competitor. I'd happily help you with that!  
**Uncensored**. You can chat and make AI art of just about depravity, even extreme NSFW (within the law).  
**Strong chat**. Is our chat any good? We have 37 LLMs: all the greats, human-like chat, uncensored chat.  
**Strong image gen**. There are 15 art models. Mostly uncensored, many art styles, can add and use LoRAs.  
**Innovative**. Group chat, full HTML/CSS/JS chat, diagrams, useful for serious stuff and NSFW too.  
**Serious**. Cutting-edge support for maths, coding, planning, analysis, writing, poetry, comedy, rap, and more.  
**Inclusive**. We support male, female, and non-binary users, all sexual preferences, chat in any language.  
**Accessibility**. We prioritise support for people with a disability, including low vision and blindness.  
**Safety**. We don't force safety features on you. But we have options to avoid sycophancy and hallucination.  
**Portable**. A progressive web app, works fine on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and others.  
**Better spam**. Written by hand, by me, the developer. I don't normally use AI or even copy-paste for my spam!  
**Support**. Small projects give good support! I listen, help users at length, give demos, add custom features.

I'm [Sam Watkins](https://www.toptal.com/resume/sam-watkins), a reputable, expert programmer from Australia, and long-time open-source enthusiast.

I think that the free access, pay what you feel approach can be viable. It's working okay so far. We're still small, but many users choose to support, and costs are low. We're profitable, and growing.

Ally Chat is not done yet. There are a few bugs! I'm working on img2img, voice chat, AI initiative, and more.
