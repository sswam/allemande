I develop and run an AI chat app called Ally Chat. I ask free users to give me feedback.

- free to use, and open source, with no hard limits
- 35 major LLMs, including many with little or no censorship
- private and group chat with multiple AIs and other users
- more than 1000 AI characters, agents, and tools
- full HTML content: images, video, CSS, JavaScript, 3D, etc
- 15 AI art models, AI prompting, regional prompting, AI vision
- math display, input, and reasoning; basic programming tools
- instantly create new private and public chat rooms and pages
- safe SFW spaces, adult spaces, and private spaces
- a progressive web app, works on web and mobile

If you'd like to try it, just tell me what name you want to use in the app. I use Sam. And let me know whether you're over 18.
