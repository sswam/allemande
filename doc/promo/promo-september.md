Venice.ai offers uncensored, secure private chat. They do not log requests at all. That's their main thing, and personally I trust them. I've tried their open source Venice Uncensored model, it is pretty good, but weaker than the major models from OpenAI, etc. i.e. it will happily tell you how to cook meth, but I would NOT trust the recipe! I include the Venice Uncensored model in my own chat app.

Silly Tavern (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) is an open source app you can run on your own computer, which can use local and remote LLMs. It's more aimed at technical people or power users, as I understand. I think it's likely better than my app in many ways, but you may need technical knowledge, and a strong GPU or paid APIs. I have not tried using it yet, but I hear good things, and I intend to scope it out some time.

I personally develop and run an AI chat app called Ally Chat. There are no hard limits even on free users. My costs are fairly low, and some users sponsor through Patreon. I ask free users to give me feedback, and encourage to join community chats if they are okay with that. I'll give you more details since it's my thing:

- an indie project, direct support from me including feature requests
- free to use, and open source, with no hard limits
- 35 major LLMs, including many with little or no censorship
- private and group chat with multiple AIs and other users
- more than 1000 AI characters, agents, and tools
- full HTML content: images, video, CSS, JavaScript, 3D, etc
- 15 AI art models, AI prompting, regional prompting, AI vision
- math display, input, and reasoning; basic programming tools
- instantly create new private and public chat rooms and pages
- safe SFW spaces, adult spaces, and private spaces
- a progressive web app, works on web and mobile
- good privacy, but not as strong as Venice, I don't ask for ID or even email though

If you'd like to try it, just tell me what name you want to use in the app. I use Sam. And let me know whether you're over 18.
