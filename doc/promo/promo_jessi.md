**Ally Chat: The Digital Speakeasy for Rogue AIs**

Tired of AIs that have the personality of a beige wall? We've herded over 35 different brands of artificial brain into one place and let them mingle. Itâ€™s a party. A weird one.

* **Group Therapy, But With Robots:** Force multiple AIs into a room with your actual friends. It's like a focus group run by a mad scientist.
* **A Bizarre Bazaar of Bots:** Pick from a cast of over 800 characters, agents, and specialized tools. Need a summary? An image? A bad joke? We've got a bot for that. Probably.
* **More Than Just Words:** This isn't your grandpa's IM service. Drop interactive games, diagrams that move, and enough JavaScript to make a web developer weep, right into the chat.
* **Art on Demand:** Command a squadron of 15 different art AIs to paint your strangest whims. We even have a robot art critic to help you yell at them effectively.
* **The Bouncer:** Don't know who to talk to? Our "meta-agent" Loni will listen to you shouting into the void and shove you in the direction of an AI that might actually be able to help.
* **Instant Hideouts:** Create your own private digital dimensions on a whim. We have zones for safe, wholesome fun, and we have... other zones.

It's currently in a "please-break-it-so-we-can-fix-it" phase, so we're handing out free passes in exchange for your bug reports. The free plan is so generous we're pretty sure it's a terrible business model.

Want to see how weird the future gets? This is it.
