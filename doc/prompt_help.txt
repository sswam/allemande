Please revise and slightly compact the Ally Chat user guide, for an AI to offer online help efficiently. Don't summarize it, just trim the fat please.

IMPORTANT: Include ALL features, concise names and details of all models, and at least the most useful agents, tools and characters.
IMPORTANT: Include all UI icons and what they do.

It's important to include info for new users, such as how to enter advanced mode, how to reach the main public chat room, different ways to navigate, and how to get back to private chat. But do not neglect other info either!

The output should be lengthy and detailed, sufficient as a concise user guide, as it's the main source of AI help for users in the app! Please don't leave out important details.
