# Ally Chat - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Help

AIs can help you learn to use the app in the main `Ally Chat` room, but not in other rooms.

Talk to Flashi, Claude or Emmy in the main chat room - they are excellent guides!

Talk to Illu or Gema if you'd like to make images - they are image generation experts.

You can also talk to Sam, the developer, or read the [User Guide](intro.md) for more information.

## How to Talk with AIs

1. To talk with a specific AI, use their name in your message:

	- At the start: "Ally, how are you?"
	- At the end: "Can you help me learn to use the app, Flashi?"
	- Using @: "@Illu, I want to draw a camel!"

2. Sometimes you need to "poke" the chat to get the next AI to respond.

	- When AIs are talking to each other...
	- Leave the message box empty.
	- Click "Poke" to let them continue.

Example:

> You: Illu, I'd like to draw a rainbow.
>
> Illu: <details><summary>Thinking</summary> ... </details>
>
>   Illy, landscape, grassland, mountains, (vibrant rainbow:1.5), (majestic mountains:1.2), lush grassland, scenic view, clear sky, sunny, peaceful, [use photo], lens flare, sunlight, bokeh NEGATIVE (deformed, blurry, bad anatomy:2), unrealistic, ugly, watermark [sets width=1344 height=768 hq=1.5 steps=30]
>
> ***[you press poke here]***
>
> Illy: [generates image]

3. Other Hints

	- If you don't use a name, the last person who spoke will respond
	- Sometimes the system may think you are talking to yourself, if you mention your own name or send two messages in a row. Try saying an AI's name.
	- Say "someone" or "anyone" to get a response from a random AI.
	- Say "everyone" to get multiple responses.

## Privacy

The `Ally Chat` room and the `nsfw/nsfw` room are public. Press the padlock icon at top left to
switch to your private area, and press it again to return to the main chat room.

- Any room beginning with your name (in lower-case) followed by a slash is private, only visible to you.
- For example, if your name is Joe, `joe/chat` and `joe/anything` are private.
- The room `joe` at the top level is public but belongs to you. You can use mod tools in it such as undoing messages, editing chat history, and clearing or archiving the room.
