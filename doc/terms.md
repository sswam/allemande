# Ally Chat - Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-17

Welcome to Ally Chat! By accessing or using our application and services ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

**1. Our Service**

Ally Chat is a free, open-source, multi-player AI chat application provided on a **best-effort basis**. The Service is offered "as is" and "as available" with no guarantees of uptime, reliability, or continued operation. Any financial support provided by users is considered a donation to support the project and does not constitute a purchase of a service, nor does it create any consumer rights or service-level expectations.

**2. Eligibility & Age Requirements**

*   You must be at least **13 years of age** to use the Service.
*   You must be at least **18 years of age** to access any chat rooms or content designated as "NSFW" (Not Safe For Work) or for adults.
By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these age requirements.

**3. User Conduct and Content Rules**

You are solely responsible for your conduct and any content you submit. You agree to abide by the following rules:

**A. General Rules for All Areas:**
*   **No Illegal Content:** You may not create, share, or engage with illegal content. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Such violations are crimes, and may result in 1. termination of access, 2. severe legal consequences. Due to the nature of the service, it is possible (though unlikely) that illegal material can be created by accident. In that case, please remove it (shield -> X), and report what happened to the operator. This helps us to make the service safer, and you will not be held responsible.
*   **No Doxxing or Harassment:** You may not share the private information of others without their consent. Harassment, hate speech, or threatening behaviour towards other users is prohibited. Violations will result in suspension of service, typically for a week or a month. Repeat violators will be suspended for exponentially longer periods of time.
*   **No Copyright Infringement:** You should not share content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. You might be suspended for a week or more, if you do this repeatedly.
*   **Community:** Please be friendly, respectful, resilient, and mostly positive in your engagement with other users. In the developer's opinion, our current AI characters are not conscious or alive; but some users (and researchers) think otherwise. Don't be grossly abusive to AI characters in the main group chats.

**B. Rules for Public, SFW (Safe For Work) Rooms (e.g., the "Ally Chat" room):**
*   You must be 13+ to enter and participate. If you are under 15, you should have permission from your parent or guardian to use the app, and they should read these terms.
*   Content should be rated "MA15+" or lower according to Australian standards.
*   No adult/NSFW content, including sexually explicit material.
*   No excessive violence or gore: think Halloween the celebration, not Halloween the movie.
*   No hate speech or extreme political content.
*   Keep discussion and language appropriate for a general audience.

**C. Rules for Public, NSFW (Not Safe For Work) Rooms (e.g., the "nsfw/nsfw" room):**
*   You must be 18+ to enter and participate.
*   Do not incite or promote violent crimes.
*   Shaming and hate speech are not permitted.
*   Different rooms may have different content guidelines; please follow them.
*   Extreme content is allowed in the main NSFW rooms, but hidden by default. Please use the filter system to hide or show specific types of content.

**4. User Content and Rights**

You retain all ownership rights to the original content you create and submit to the Service.

However, by submitting content to a group chat room, you grant Ally Chat a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display and distribute that content within the context of the Service. Content submitted to a group chat is persistent, and we do not guarantee the ability to remove your specific messages from group chat histories.

Some group chat rooms are designated as "open source." By submitting content to such rooms, you agree to license your contributions under the open license specified in the room header. If no license is specified, the MIT-license will apply. Please review room headers carefully before posting; you may not be able to withdraw or restrict the use of content submitted to these rooms.

**5. Privacy and Data**

*   **Encryption:** Communications with our servers are encrypted in transit (HTTPS). However, to facilitate the group chat nature of the service, data is not encrypted at rest on our servers.
*   **Data Privacy:** We never sell your personal data and use it only to provide the service. Please note that some third-party AI providers we integrate with (e.g., OpenAI) may use conversation data to train future models. For users who prefer stricter privacy, we also offer providers like Venice that do not retain your data or use it for any purpose.
*   **Access Control:** We use strong access control mechanisms to protect user privacy and the integrity of private rooms.

**6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability**

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE OFFER ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPERS OF ALLY CHAT DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE.

**7. Modification of Terms**

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes via an in-app message that provides a summary of the changes and a link to the updated document. Your continued use of the Service after receiving such notification constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

**8. Termination**

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our sole discretion, for any reason or for no reason, and without prior notice. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, a breach of these Terms, illegal conduct, or operational or financial constraints of the Service.

Upon request following termination, we will provide you with a copy of your data from the Service, excluding any content that was determined to be illegal. While termination decisions are made at our discretion, users are welcome to contact us to discuss the possibility of restored access. We will consider such requests in good faith.

**9. Governing Law**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia.

<summary>AI Review of Terms of Service</summary>
We aim to be transparent regarding what we can and cannot offer to users. In this spirit, here is an AI review of our terms of service, highlighting any potentially concerning elements.

From a user's perspective, there are several points worth noting:
 
Potentially Concerning Elements:
1. The "as is" and "best-effort" nature means there are no guarantees of service reliability or uptime
2. Group chat messages are permanent with no guaranteed way to delete them
3. While communications are encrypted in transit, data is not encrypted at rest on their servers
4. The service can terminate access at any time without prior notice
5. The terms can be changed (though they do promise to provide notice)
6. Upstream AI model providers may use data for training purposes, which could raise privacy concerns
7. The broad disclaimer of liability means users have limited recourse if something goes wrong
 
Positive Elements:
1. Users retain ownership of their content
2. They don't sell user data
3. Clear age restrictions for different types of content
4. Transparent rules about acceptable content
5. Promise to provide data upon request after termination
6. Clear privacy and encryption policies
7. Straightforward content guidelines for both SFW and NSFW areas
 
Overall, while these terms are fairly standard for a free service, users should be particularly aware that their messages are permanent and that the service offers no guarantees. Users should also be mindful about sharing sensitive information given the data storage practices and upstream AI provider policies.
