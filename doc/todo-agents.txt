TODO:
✓ remote agents, add key as name
- remote models: need option to limit context by tokens not messages
- move config.sh and agents to ~/my/allemande/$hostname and symlink back
✓ could keep agents under rooms?  makes sense...
	- done for local agents at least

✓ conductor for multi addressing like @Emmy and @Claude, do you like the pictures?
	- issue, this syntax will provoke the AI's to also use @ notation. We could possibly remove it when converting to HTML, or convert them to links.
		- or just allow the AI to use it, that's fine
