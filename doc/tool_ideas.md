Your current set of AI tools covers some essential operations, but there are indeed more possibilities that could enhance your toolkit. Here are some additional ideas for AI tools that could be useful:

1. Split: As you mentioned, a tool to split content into multiple files would be valuable.
2. Summarize: A tool that can provide concise summaries of longer texts.
3. Translate: A tool for translating text between different languages.
4. Classify: A tool that can categorize text into predefined categories or topics.
5. Extract: A tool to extract specific information (e.g., names, dates, locations) from text.
6. Paraphrase: A tool that can rephrase text while maintaining its original meaning.
7. Generate: A tool for creating new content based on given parameters or prompts.
8. Compare: A tool to compare two or more texts and highlight similarities and differences.
9. Sentiment analysis: A tool to determine the emotional tone of a piece of text.
10. Format conversion: A tool to convert between different file formats (e.g., PDF to text, HTML to Markdown).
11. Spell and grammar check: A tool to identify and correct spelling and grammatical errors.
12. Keyword extraction: A tool to identify the most important words or phrases in a text.
13. Text-to-speech / Speech-to-text: Tools for converting between written and spoken language.
14. Data visualization: A tool to create visual representations of textual data or statistics.
15. Anonymize: A tool to remove or replace personally identifiable information in text.

These additional tools could significantly expand the capabilities of your AI toolkit, allowing for more diverse and complex text processing tasks. The specific tools you choose to implement would depend on your particular needs and use cases.

We need to do similar for all permutations of media types:

data, text, code, image, audio, video
multimedia
text: markdown
text: html
text: music

data: tsv

Tag tools rather than putting them in folders, or have a "multi" folder and symlink to each media folder.

Here's a brainstorm of ideas related to "other types of media":

text	Chatbots
text	Digital magazines
text	Interactive e-books
text	Newsletters
image	Animated GIFs
image	Digital billboards
image	Digital graffiti/street art
image	Digital signage
image	Drone photography/videography
image	Infographics
image	Interactive billboards
image	Interactive data visualizations
image	Memes
image	Motion comics
image	Webcomics
audio	ASMR videos
audio	Audiobooks
audio	Podcasts
audio	Voice assistants (like Alexa or Siri)
video	360-degree videos
video	Live streaming platforms
video	Social media stories/reels
video	Vlogs
video	Webinars
other	3D printing outputs
other	Augmented reality applications
other	Digital art installations
other	Educational simulations
other	Gamified educational content
other	Holographic concerts
other	Holographic displays
other	Immersive theater experiences
other	Interactive kiosks
other	Interactive museum exhibits
other	Mobile apps
other	Projection mapping
other	QR code experiences
other	Video games
other	Virtual reality experiences
other	Wearable technology displays

These ideas span a wide range of digital and interactive media types, incorporating various technologies and formats beyond traditional print, radio, and television.

Suggested categories:
interactive
immersive
digital fabrication
mixed reality
gamification

image	SVG	vector images are a bit different
image	maps	?

3d models
voxel images
