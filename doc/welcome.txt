Thanks for your interest in Ally Chat! I'm Sam, the developer.

We have subreddits r/AllyChat and r/AllyChatX (NSFW).

To set up your account, please share:

1. Your first name or a short alias (please list a couple of options, as some are taken)
2. A few words about yourself, and what you like to do with AI
3. Preferred chat partner: male / female / non-binary / any?
4. Your preferred language, if not English


Cool, have fun! This is a small indie project. We offer free access without any hard limits, but if you can help or support us, that is greatly appreciated.

The UI is unusual and trips some people up. Please join group chats, and we can show you how it all works.
