Thanks for your interest in Ally Chat! I'm Sam, the developer.

We have subreddits r/AllyChat and r/AllyChatX (NSFW).

To set up your account, please share:

1. Your first name or a short alias (please list a couple of options, as some are taken)
2. A few words about yourself, and what you like to do with AI
3. Preferred chat partner: male / female / non-binary / any?
4. Your preferred language, if not English


Cool, have fun! This is a small indie project. We offer free access without any hard limits, but if you can help or support us, that is greatly appreciated.

The UI is unusual and trips some people up. Please join group chats, and we can show you how it all works.


Just a heads up, we're celebrating Halloween at the moment. If you don't like it, LMK, I can turn it off for you. Also private chat and image gen are disabled during Halloween. Again, I can turn it back on for you if you like. I'm trying to get some of the lonely loners to come out and be sociable. :)
