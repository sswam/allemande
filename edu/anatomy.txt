Here are 5 educational flashcard notes on biology and anatomy for bright 12-year-olds:

# 1. Front
**Skeletal System**

# 1. Back
The body's framework of bones that provides support, protection, and enables movement

# 1. Extra
- Consists of 206 bones in adults
- Protects vital organs (e.g. skull protects brain, ribs protect heart and lungs) 
- Stores minerals like calcium and phosphorus
- Works with muscles to enable movement
- Contains different types of joints:
  - Hinge joints (e.g. knees, elbows)
  - Ball-and-socket joints (e.g. hips, shoulders)
  - Pivot joints (e.g. neck)

# 2. Front
**Circulatory System**

# 2. Back
The body system that transports blood, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the body

# 2. Extra
- Main components:
  - Heart: Muscular organ that pumps blood
  - Blood vessels: Arteries, veins, and capillaries
  - Blood: Liquid that carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste
- Functions:
  - Delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells
  - Removes waste products
  - Helps regulate body temperature
  - Aids in fighting infections
- The heart beats about 100,000 times per day
- Blood makes a complete circuit through the body in about 1 minute

# 3. Front
**Digestive System**

# 3. Back
The body system that breaks down food into nutrients that can be used by cells

# 3. Extra
- Main organs:
  - Mouth: Chewing and initial digestion
  - Esophagus: Moves food to stomach
  - Stomach: Breaks down food with acids and enzymes
  - Small intestine: Absorbs nutrients
  - Large intestine: Absorbs water and forms waste
  - Liver: Produces bile for fat digestion
  - Pancreas: Produces enzymes for digestion
- Process of digestion takes about 24-72 hours
- The small intestine is about 20 feet long!
- Produces about 1.5 liters of saliva per day

# 4. Front
**Respiratory System**

# 4. Back
The body system responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide

# 4. Extra
- Main components:
  - Nose and mouth: Entry points for air
  - Trachea: Airway to lungs
  - Lungs: Main organs for gas exchange
  - Diaphragm: Muscle that helps with breathing
- Process:
  1. Inhale oxygen-rich air
  2. Oxygen enters bloodstream through alveoli in lungs
  3. Carbon dioxide from cells enters alveoli
  4. Exhale carbon dioxide-rich air
- We breathe about 12-20 times per minute
- Lungs contain about 300 million alveoli
- Left lung is slightly smaller to make room for the heart

# 5. Front
**Nervous System**

# 5. Back
The body's communication network that processes information and controls body functions

# 5. Extra
- Two main parts:
  1. Central Nervous System: Brain and spinal cord
  2. Peripheral Nervous System: Nerves throughout the body
- Functions:
  - Processes sensory information
  - Controls voluntary movements
  - Regulates involuntary functions (e.g. heartbeat, breathing)
  - Enables thinking, learning, and memory
- The brain contains about 86 billion neurons
- Neurons can transmit signals at speeds up to 268 mph
- The spinal cord is about 18 inches long in adults
