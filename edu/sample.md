Here are 100 illuminating flashcard topics for programmers about deep learning, with main terms in bold and numbered for easy reference:

# 1. Neural Network
A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected **nodes** (neurons) organized in layers.

# 2. Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses **multi-layered neural networks** to learn hierarchical representations of data.

# 3. Perceptron
The simplest form of a neural network, consisting of a single **artificial neuron** with weighted inputs and an activation function.

# 4. Activation Function
A mathematical function that determines the **output** of a neural network node based on its input.

# 5. Sigmoid Function
An **S-shaped activation function** that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.

# 6. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
An activation function that outputs the input directly if positive, otherwise it outputs zero. Helps mitigate the **vanishing gradient problem**.

# 7. Backpropagation
An algorithm used to **calculate gradients** in neural networks by propagating errors backward through the network.
