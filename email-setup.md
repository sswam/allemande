Essential Email Server Setup Components:

1. DNS Authentication Records
- PTR (Reverse DNS):
    * Critical for preventing spam flagging
    * Contact your VPS provider's support to set this up
    * Must match your server's forward DNS

- SPF (Sender Policy Framework):
    * Specifies authorized mail servers for your domain
    * Prevents email spoofing
    * Add TXT record listing permitted sending servers

- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
    * Adds digital signature to verify email authenticity
    * Helps prove emails weren't tampered with in transit
    * Requires key pair setup and DNS configuration

- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication):
    * Builds on SPF and DKIM
    * Provides handling instructions for failed authentications
    * Enables monitoring through reporting mechanisms

2. Security Configuration
- TLS Encryption:
    * Configure Postfix to use TLS for transit encryption
    * Becoming standard requirement for providers
    * Improves deliverability and security
