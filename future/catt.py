# Please write a python program to concatenate files with a black line between them (or --sep option), be careful if files don't end in a newline, optionally adding file headings with filenames (full path or basenames), with an optional prefix (e.g. 'llm-last /tmp/sam.pGpnQY3EqX/vd.old.llm-last ' for a markdown heading), optionally number the files (number in each heading like `llm-last /tmp/sam.pGpnQY3EqX/vd.old.llm-last 1. hello.py`, and optional markdown quoting in ``` for code files (extension not txt or md). Let me know if you can think of any other useful options, this is mainly intended to present code for an AI to process. Maybe if an input is hello.py:hello, it can extract just the 'hello' function, but I'm not sure how to do that generally for every programming language. (We could assume the code is well-formatted.) Thanks, you awesome robot you!
