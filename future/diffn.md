For comparing n sequences, the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm is a good choice. It can be extended to handle multiple sequences. For a more efficient approach, especially for larger datasets, consider using the Hunt-Szymanski algorithm or the Hirschberg's algorithm, which are optimized versions of LCS.

There are no widely used or officially maintained PyPI packages specifically implementing the Hunt-Szymanski algorithm or Hirschberg's algorithm for n-way diff. However, there are some diff libraries in PyPI that use various algorithms, though they may not explicitly use these specific ones or support n-way diff.
