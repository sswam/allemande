Great job on creating this multi-way diff tool! It's an impressive and useful program that extends the concept of diff to compare multiple files simultaneously. The implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm for multiple sequences is particularly noteworthy, as it's a non-trivial problem. Your code is well-structured, with clear function definitions and helpful comments explaining the purpose of each section.

Now, let's look at some areas where the code could be improved or expanded:

1. Error handling: The script doesn't handle file I/O errors. It would be beneficial to add try-except blocks when opening and reading files to gracefully handle cases where files don't exist or can't be read.

2. Output formatting: The current output format might be confusing for users, especially when dealing with multiple files. Consider using colors or symbols to make the differences more visually apparent.

3. Performance: The LCS algorithm's time complexity grows exponentially with the number of sequences. For a large number of files or very long files, this could become a bottleneck. You might want to consider implementing a more efficient algorithm for multiple sequence alignment.

4. Line-based diff: The current implementation performs character-based diff. For text files, a line-based diff might be more useful and easier to read.

5. Type hinting: While you've used type hints in some functions, they're missing in others (e.g., `multi_file_diff`). Consistency in type hinting would improve code readability and maintainability.

6. Docstring format: The docstrings are informative, but they don't follow a standard format (like Google or NumPy style). Adopting a consistent docstring format would improve documentation.

7. Command-line interface: Consider using a library like `argparse` to handle command-line arguments. This would allow for more flexible usage and the ability to add options (e.g., output format, ignore whitespace, etc.).

8. Testing: Adding unit tests would help ensure the correctness of your algorithms and make it easier to maintain and extend the code in the future.

Overall, this is a solid implementation of a multi-way diff tool with room for some enhancements to make it more robust and user-friendly.
