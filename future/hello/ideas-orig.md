Your code templates are already quite good, but here are some suggestions to improve them further:

1. For `hello.py`:

   a. Consider using type hints for better code readability and static type checking:
      ```python
      def hello(lines: List[str], name: str = "World", reverse: bool = False) -> List[str]:
      ```

   b. Use f-strings consistently throughout the code for better readability:
      ```python
      logger.error(f"Error: {type(e).__name__} {str(e)}")
      ```

   c. Consider adding a `__version__` variable to the module for version tracking.

   d. Add more detailed docstrings for the module and functions, including examples.

   e. Consider using `argparse` instead of `argh` for more flexibility in argument parsing.

   f. Add a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to make the script both importable and executable.

2. For `tests/hello_test.py`:

   a. Use parametrized tests to cover more test cases with less code:
      ```python
      @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_lines, name, reverse, expected", [
          (["Line 1", "Line 2"], "World", False, ["Hello, World", "Line 1", "Line 2"]),
          (["Line 1", "Line 2"], "Sam", True, ["Line 2", "Line 1", "Hello, Sam"]),
      ])
      def test_hello(input_lines, name, reverse, expected):
          assert hello(input_lines, name=name, reverse=reverse) == expected
      ```

   b. Add more test cases to cover edge cases and potential errors.

   c. Consider using `pytest.fixture` for common setup code.

   d. Add tests for the command-line interface using `subprocess` to run the script.

3. General improvements:

   a. Add a `requirements.txt` file to list dependencies.

   b. Create a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` file for packaging.

   c. Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

   d. Include a `README.md` file with usage instructions and examples.

   e. Consider adding a `Makefile` or `tox.ini` for automating common tasks like running tests and linting.

   f. Add type checking with `mypy` and linting with `flake8` or `pylint`.

   g. Set up continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions or similar tools.

These suggestions will help improve code quality, maintainability, and ease of use for your Python toolkit.
