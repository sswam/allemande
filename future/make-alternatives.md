If you're looking for alternatives to Make that offer dependency-based, parallel-capable processing with clearer syntax, here are a few options:

1. Snakemake:
   Snakemake is a Python-based workflow management system that's designed to be a more readable and flexible alternative to Make. It uses a Python-like syntax and supports parallel execution.

   Example:
   ```python
   rule all:
       input:
           "country_city_timezone.tsv"

   rule download_cities:
       output:
           "cities15000.zip"
       shell:
           "curl https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities15000.zip > {output}"

   rule unzip_cities:
       input:
           "cities15000.zip"
       output:
           "cities15000.txt"
       shell:
           "unzip {input}"

   # ... other rules ...

   rule create_final_output:
       input:
           cities="city_timezone.tsv",
           countries="country_code.tsv"
       output:
           "country_city_timezone.tsv"
       shell:
           "joine <(< {input.countries} nohead | order) <(< {input.cities} nohead | order) | "
           "addhead code country city timezone | "
           "kutout 1 > {output}"
   ```

2. Doit:
   Doit is another Python-based task management and automation tool. It's designed to be simpler than Make but still powerful.

   Example:
   ```python
   def task_download_cities():
       return {
           'actions': ['curl https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities15000.zip > cities15000.zip'],
           'targets': ['cities15000.zip'],
       }

   def task_unzip_cities():
       return {
           'actions': ['unzip cities15000.zip'],
           'file_dep': ['cities15000.zip'],
           'targets': ['cities15000.txt'],
       }

   # ... other tasks ...

   def task_create_final_output():
       return {
           'actions': [
               'joine <(< country_code.tsv nohead | order) <(< city_timezone.tsv nohead | order) | '
               'addhead code country city timezone | '
               'kutout 1 > country_city_timezone.tsv'
           ],
           'file_dep': ['city_timezone.tsv', 'country_code.tsv'],
           'targets': ['country_city_timezone.tsv'],
       }
   ```

3. Just:
   Just is a command runner that's designed to be simpler than Make. It uses a straightforward YAML-like syntax.

   Example:
   ```justfile
   all: country_city_timezone.tsv

   cities15000.zip:
       curl "https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities15000.zip" > cities15000.zip

   cities15000.txt: cities15000.zip
       unzip cities15000.zip

   # ... other recipes ...

   country_city_timezone.tsv: city_timezone.tsv country_code.tsv
       joine <(< country_code.tsv nohead | order) <(< city_timezone.tsv nohead | order) | \
           addhead code country city timezone | \
           kutout 1 > country_city_timezone.tsv
   ```

These alternatives offer clearer syntax while maintaining the dependency-based and parallel processing capabilities of Make. They're generally more verbose than Make but provide better readability and often come with additional features that can make complex workflows easier to manage.
