The script is blocking at EOF (End of File) rather than exiting because the `processor` task is designed to run indefinitely. The `while True` loop in the `processor` function keeps it running even after all items from the producer have been processed. Here's how you can modify the script to exit properly:

1. Add a sentinel value to signal the end of processing:

```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles

SENTINEL = object()  # Unique object to signal end of queue

async def producer(queue):
    for i in range(5):
        await queue.put(f'event {i}')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Mocking I/O work
    await queue.put(SENTINEL)  # Signal end of production

async def processor(queue):
    while True:
        item = await queue.get()
        if item is SENTINEL:
            queue.task_done()
            break
        print(f'Processed {item}')
        queue.task_done()

async def main():
    queue = asyncio.Queue()
    producer_task = asyncio.create_task(producer(queue))
    processor_task = asyncio.create_task(processor(queue))

    await producer_task
    await queue.join()

    # No need to cancel processor_task, it will exit on its own

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this modified version:

1. We introduce a `SENTINEL` object to signal the end of the queue.
2. The `producer` function puts the `SENTINEL` into the queue after it's done producing events.
3. The `processor` function checks for the `SENTINEL` and breaks its loop when it encounters it.
4. We remove the `processor_task.cancel()` line because the processor will exit on its own when it sees the `SENTINEL`.

This approach allows the script to exit naturally once all items have been processed, without blocking at EOF. The `processor` task will terminate itself when it receives the sentinel value, and the script will complete execution.
