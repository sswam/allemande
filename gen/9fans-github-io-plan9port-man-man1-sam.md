**SAM Text Editor Summary**

*Sam* is a multi-file editor that modifies local copies of files, with a menu accessed via mouse button 3 or the `n` command. It supports regular expressions similar to *regexp(7)* with newline representation (`\n`). Addresses specify substrings, using simple addresses like line numbers or regular expression matches, and compound addresses for relative positioning. Commands include text manipulation (`a`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `s`, `m`, `t`), display (`p`, `=`), file management (`b`, `B`, `n`, `D`), I/O (`e`, `r`, `w`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `!`, `cd`), loops and conditionals (`x`, `y`, `X`, `Y`, `g`, `v`), and miscellaneous actions (`k`, `q`, `u`). Commands can be grouped with braces, and multiple changes are computed in the original file state. The terminal interface allows window operations and text manipulation via mouse buttons. *Sam* communicates through the edit plumb port or a named pipe. *B* loads files into a *sam* instance, and *E* acts as a Unix editor. Abnormal termination saves modified files in `$HOME/sam.save`.
