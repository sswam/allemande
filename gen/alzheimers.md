# Strategies to reduce Alzheimer's risk

## TL;DR

Take care of your brain to lower Alzheimer's risk. Get regular check-ups and
brain tests. Live healthy: exercise, eat well, sleep enough, manage stress, be
social, and keep your mind active. Control health issues, stay at a good
weight, don't smoke or drink too much. Avoid head injuries, pollution, and
heavy metals. Ask a doctor about supplements. Keep up with Alzheimer's news, do
brain training, and get health screenings. For heavy metals, test levels, detox
if needed, remove mercury fillings, and watch out for lead.
