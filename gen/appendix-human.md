### Function of the Human Appendix

The human appendix is not completely unnecessary as it can store good bacteria to repopulate the colon after illness, helping maintain healthy gut flora and playing a role in the gut's defense against infection. People without an appendix experience recurring intestinal infections more than people with an intact appendix. Research suggests the appendix has evolved independently multiple times and has been maintained for millions of years. The existence of a functional appendix does not disprove evolution or vestigial structures.
