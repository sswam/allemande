Please rework `code/doc`. obfuscated

## 1. code/doc:

#!/bin/bash -eu
# doc:	basic documentation for code
cat-named "$@" | process "Please write some basic documentation for this code."

Here's an obfuscated version of the `code/doc` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eu
eval "$(echo 'Y2F0LW5hbWVkICIkQCIgfCBwcm9jZXNzICJQbGVhc2Ugd3JpdGUgc29tZSBiYXNpYyBkb2N1bWVudGF0aW9uIGZvciB0aGlzIGNvZGUuIg==' | base64 -d)"
```

This obfuscated version does the following:

1. It uses `base64` encoding to obscure the actual command.
2. The encoded string is then decoded and executed using `eval`.

The obfuscated script still performs the same function as the original, but the actual command is not immediately readable. Note that this obfuscation method is relatively simple and can be easily reversed by decoding the base64 string.
