Claud:
Here are several important techniques for building reliable, high-quality code when handling financial transactions:

Comprehensive Testing
- Write extensive unit tests covering edge cases
- Integration tests for full transaction flows
- Property-based testing for complex logic
- Load/stress testing for concurrent operations
- Continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline

Code Review & Quality
- Mandatory code reviews before merging
- Static analysis tools (e.g. pylint, mypy)
- Type hints for better catching of errors
- Clear documentation of critical paths
- Keep methods small and focused

Transaction Safety
- Use database transactions to maintain consistency
- Implement idempotency for all operations
- Audit logging of all state changes
- Verification steps before commits
- Atomic operations where possible

Error Handling
- Explicit error states and handling
- Graceful degradation
- Transaction rollbacks on failure
- Detailed error logging
- Circuit breakers for external services

Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/authorization
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Regular security audits

Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time monitoring of transactions
- Automated alerts for anomalies
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Regular auditing of logs

Design Patterns
- Command pattern for transactions
- State pattern for item status
- Observer pattern for notifications
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for object creation

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?
