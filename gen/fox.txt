In a flash, a rust-hued vulpine creature,
Agile and swift, with fur so sleek,
Leaps gracefully o'er a canine feature -
A drowsy hound, so mild and meek.

This phrase, a pangram, cleverly designed,
Employs each letter, A through Z,
A linguistic feat, precisely refined,
To test typefaces with playful ease.
