### Summary of Wikipedia's "Gaza Genocide" Article

The "Gaza genocide" refers to the ongoing destruction of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by Israel during the Gaza war, involving mass killings, starvation, bodily and mental harm, preventing births, blockades, infrastructure destruction, and cultural site destruction. Recognized by UN committees, scholars, and human rights groups, it has resulted in over 66,000 reported deaths as of October 2025, mostly civilians, with thousands more uncounted. South Africa has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging violation of the Genocide Convention, which Israel denies. The ICJ has ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts and allow humanitarian aid, orders which have not been complied with. The situation is set against a backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the blockade of Gaza. There is evidence of genocidal intent via eliminationist rhetoric and actions that exceed military objectives. Genocidal acts include direct killings, indirect deaths from starvation and lack of healthcare, destruction of civilian infrastructure, forced displacement, attacks on healthcare, and destruction of cultural sites. Academic and legal discourse is increasingly recognizing the situation as genocide. Various legal proceedings are underway, including the ICJ case and actions at the International Criminal Court, while third states are being scrutinized for their responsibility in preventing genocide. Numerous NGOs and intergovernmental organizations have accused Israel of genocide. The conflict has had a profound cultural impact, with widespread protests and debates about the legitimacy of Israel and the international order.
