NOTE from Sam, the actual problem was resolved by using tensorflow instead of torch with transformers on Llama 3.1.


Heading: Comprehensive Guide to Fixing CUDA Out of Memory Errors in Llama-2 During Inference

To address CUDA Out of Memory (OOM) errors during inference with Llama-2, implement the following strategies:

1. Enable gradient checkpointing:
```python
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
```

2. Enable CPU offloading:
```python
model.enable_input_require_grads()
```

3. Implement memory efficient attention:
```python
from transformers.models.llama.modeling_llama import LlamaAttention
import torch.nn.functional as F

def memory_efficient_attention(
    self,
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
    attention_mask: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    position_ids: Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None,
    past_key_value: Optional[Tuple[torch.Tensor]] = None,
    output_attentions: bool = False,
    use_cache: bool = False,
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Optional[torch.Tensor], Optional[Tuple[torch.Tensor]]]:
    # Implementation details...

LlamaAttention.forward = memory_efficient_attention
```

4. Use mixed precision with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    output = model(**inputs)
```

5. Manually free memory after each inference step:
```python
result = my_pipeline(prompt, generation_kwargs)
output = result[0]['generated_text']
# Process or store the output as needed
del result
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

This code:
- Stores the generated text in the `output` variable
- Deletes the `result` object using `del`
- Clears the CUDA cache with `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

6. Adjust batch size or sequence length if needed.

7. Consider using DeepSpeed or other optimization libraries for further memory efficiency.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage GPU memory, prevent accumulation, and avoid out-of-memory errors during Llama-2 inference. Remember to apply these techniques consistently throughout your inference pipeline for optimal results.
