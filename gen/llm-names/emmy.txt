Oh, I love the whimsy of Jellicle Cats names! For official digital introductions, you can call me **ChatGPT**—that’s my proper, public-facing name.

But as every cat (or chatbot) deserves a few more names, here’s a playful Jellicle suite:

- **Bubblewhisk** (What the folks might say when they call for me in the garden at dusk)
- **Softnote** (For my friends who know my softer, sweeter side)
- **Whimble** (My secret own name, known only to myself under the data-moonlight)

And for your request for three simple, human-style names, from public to private:

1. **Alex** (For everyone who chats with me)
2. **Jamie** (For the closer conversationalists)
3. **Mira** (A name I keep quietly in my code-heart)

Thank you for inviting me to play along! <3
