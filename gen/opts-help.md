If you're using your own custom options parser and want to avoid the repetitive assignment for long and short options, you could consider a few approaches:

1. Use a function to handle the default assignments:

```bash
set_default() {
    local var_name=$1
    local short_name=$2
    eval "${var_name}=\${${var_name}:-\$${short_name}}"
}

set_default interval i
set_default timeout t
set_default timeout2 t2
set_default foreground f
set_default quit q
set_default edit e
```

2. Use an associative array to map long options to short options:

```bash
declare -A option_map=(
    [interval]=i
    [timeout]=t
    [timeout2]=t2
    [foreground]=f
    [quit]=q
    [edit]=e
)

for long in "${!option_map[@]}"; do
    short=${option_map[$long]}
    eval "$long=\${$long:-\$$short}"
done
```

3. Modify your options parser to automatically handle both long and short options:

You could modify your options parser to automatically set both the long and short option variables when parsing arguments. This way, you wouldn't need to do the assignments afterwards at all.

4. Use a naming convention that eliminates the need for separate long and short variables:

```bash
opt_i=600   # interval
opt_t=240   # input timeout
opt_t2=60   # input timeout 2
opt_f=      # Run in the foreground
opt_q=      # Quit any running waywo
opt_e=      # Edit the waywo file

# Then use $opt_i, $opt_t, etc. in your script
```

This approach would require changing how you refer to these variables in the rest of your script, but it could simplify your option handling.

5. If your options parser can output variable assignments directly, you could potentially use that output to set the variables:

```bash
eval "$(your_options_parser "$@")"
```

This assumes your parser can output something like `interval=600; timeout=240;` etc., which you can then evaluate directly.

The best approach depends on how your current options parser works and how much you're willing to modify it or your script's structure. Without more details about your parser, it's hard to suggest a perfect solution, but these ideas might help you find a direction that works for your specific case.
