Python 2.0 introduced significant changes to the language, primarily focusing on Unicode support, list comprehensions, augmented assignment, and string methods.  

**Unicode Support:**
- Introduced a new fundamental data type: Unicode strings, represented as `u"string"`.
- Allowed arbitrary Unicode characters using `\u{HHHH}` escape sequence.
- Added built-in functions like `unichr`, `ord`, and `unicode` for Unicode manipulation.
- Introduced the `unicodedata` module for accessing Unicode character properties.
- Defined a codec API for implementing and registering new encodings.
- Enabled Unicode-aware regular expressions through the `re` module with SRE implementation.
- Added `-U` command-line option for interpreting all string literals as Unicode.

**List Comprehensions:**
- Introduced a concise syntax for creating new lists based on existing sequences.
- Allowed filtering elements and applying functions to each element in a list.
- Equivalent to nested loops with an optional `if` condition.

**Augmented Assignment:**
- Added augmented assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.
- Allowed in-place modification of variables, similar to other programming languages.
- Implemented through special methods like `__iadd__` for classes.

**String Methods:**
- Moved string manipulation functionalities from the `string` module to string methods.
- Enabled methods like `capitalize`, `replace`, `find` for both 8-bit and Unicode strings.
- Introduced new methods `startswith` and `endswith`.
- Modified `join` method to behave like the old `string.join` function.

**Other Language Changes:**
- `f(*args, **kw)` syntax for calling functions with tuples and dictionaries.
- Redirection of `print` statement output to file-like objects.
- Renaming modules during import using `import module as name`.
- Added `%r` format style for inserting `repr` of an argument.
- Introduced `__contains__` method for overriding the `in` operator.
- Implemented a non-recursive algorithm for deleting objects to prevent stack overflow.
- Modified error message for `AttributeError` and `NameError` exceptions.

**Built-in Functions Changes:**
- Added `zip` function for creating lists of tuples from sequences.
- Introduced `int` and `long` functions accepting a base parameter for string conversions.
- Added `sys.version_info` for more detailed version information.
- Introduced `setdefault` method for dictionaries.
- Allowed reading and modifying maximum recursion depth using `sys.getrecursionlimit` and `sys.setrecursionlimit`.

**Garbage Collection of Cycles:**
- Implemented a cycle detection algorithm for garbage collection, fixing memory leaks caused by cycles.
- Introduced the `gc` module for garbage collection control.
- Enabled disabling cycle detection using `--without-cycle-gc` flag during compilation.

**Other Core Changes:**
- Converted Python source code to ANSI C.
- Increased the limit for literal lists and dictionaries in source files.
- Added convenience functions for adding constants to module dictionaries.
- Introduced a wrapper API for Unix-style signal handlers.

**Distutils:**
- Introduced a system for easy module installation, automating platform detection, compiler recognition, and installation process.
- Used `setup.py` scripts for managing module installation.
- Added commands like `sdist` for creating source distributions.

**XML Modules:**
- Introduced the `xml` package with SAX2 and DOM support for processing XML.
- Provided `xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler` class for SAX-based XML parsing.
- Introduced `xml.dom.minidom` module for DOM-based XML representation.

**Module Changes:**
- Added OpenSSL support to the `socket` module for encrypted communication.
- Rewritten the `httplib` module to support HTTP/1.1.
- Extended `Tkinter` module to support Tcl/Tk 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3.
- Enhanced `curses` module to provide more functionalities from ncurses and SYSV curses.
- Replaced the underlying regular expression engine with SRE for Unicode support.

**New Modules:**
- Introduced several new modules like `atexit`, `codecs`, `filecmp`, `gettext`, `linuxaudiodev`, `mmap`, `pyexpat`, `robotparser`, `tabnanny`, `UserString`, `webbrowser`, `_winreg`, `zipfile`, and `imputil`.

**IDLE Improvements:**
- Enhanced IDLE with UI improvements, class browser enhancements, tab width customization, browser support, command line, call tips, and new keystroke commands.

**Deleted and Deprecated Modules:**
- Removed the `stdwin` module.
- Moved several modules to the `lib-old` directory, marking them as deprecated.
