Python 2.1 introduced significant changes to the language, including:

**Nested Scopes (PEP 227):**  Introduced static scoping, allowing functions to access variables from enclosing scopes. This addressed issues with recursive function definitions and lambda expressions. However, it required changes to `from module import *` and `exec` statements, making them illegal within certain function scopes. 

**__future__ Directives (PEP 236):** Introduced the `from __future__ import` statement, allowing programmers to selectively enable new language features that would become standard in later releases. This provided a mechanism for gradual adoption of features like nested scopes, mitigating potential compatibility issues.

**Rich Comparisons (PEP 207):** Enhanced the way comparison operations worked on user-defined classes and extension types. It introduced magic methods for overloading each comparison operator (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`), allowing for more flexible and powerful comparisons. 

**Warning Framework (PEP 230):**  Implemented a framework for managing warnings related to deprecated features. This allowed for a more structured approach to removing obsolete features from the language, providing ample time for users to adapt.

**New Build System (PEP 229):** The Distutils were leveraged to automate the compilation of a larger portion of the standard library extension modules. This simplified the build process and made Python installations more feature-rich. 

**Weak References (PEP 205):** Introduced the `weakref` module, allowing the creation of weak references to objects, which do not prevent those objects from being garbage collected. This enabled more efficient memory management, particularly in scenarios like object caches and circular references.

**Function Attributes (PEP 232):** Allowed functions to have arbitrary information attached to them through attributes, providing a more flexible way to store metadata associated with functions. This was a useful alternative to using docstrings for purposes beyond documentation. 

**Importing Modules on Case-Insensitive Platforms (PEP 235):**  Implemented a mechanism for case-sensitive module imports on case-insensitive operating systems like Windows and MacOS.  This ensures consistent behavior across different platforms.

**Interactive Display Hook (PEP 217):** Introduced the `sys.displayhook` variable, enabling customization of how interactive interpreter output was displayed. This allowed for enhanced control over presentation, such as using pretty-printing functions.

**New Coercion Model (PEP 208):** Significantly modified the numeric coercion model at the C level, providing greater flexibility for authors of C extensions who needed to implement numeric operations on extension types.

**Metadata in Python Packages (PEP 241):** Introduced the `PKG-INFO` file, which contains metadata about Python packages, such as name, version, and author. This paved the way for better package management and centralized catalogs. 

In addition to these major language changes, Python 2.1 also included a number of new modules, improved existing ones, and made various other changes and fixes. These included:

* **New Modules:** `inspect`, `pydoc`, `doctest`, `difflib`, `curses.panel`, `xml`
* **Improved Modules:** `time`, `ftplib`, `socket`, `pstats`
* **Other Changes:** Faster line-oriented file I/O, new dictionary method `popitem`,  an optional object allocator, enhanced syntax error reporting, and more.

These improvements and additions made Python 2.1 a significant release, bringing valuable features and refinements to the language.
