Python 2.2 introduced significant changes to the language, including:

**Type and Class Changes:**

* **New-style classes:** Subclassing built-in types like lists and integers became possible.
* **Static and class methods:** Introduced methods that are not bound to instances or classes.
* **Properties:**  A new mechanism allowing methods to be called on attribute access or setting.
* **Slots:**  Limited the legal attributes of an instance to a defined set.

**Iterators and Generators:**

* **Iterators:** An iteration interface for objects that can be looped over.
* **Generators:** Resumable functions using the `yield` keyword, allowing for efficient iteration.

**Division Operator Changes:**

* **Floor division operator (`//`):** Introduced to always perform floor division regardless of operand type.
* **True division:**  Enabled true division using `from __future__ import division` to change the behavior of the `/` operator.

**Unicode Changes:**

* **UCS-4 support:**  Python can now be compiled to use UCS-4 internally, allowing for wider Unicode character support.
* **Decode method:**  Added to 8-bit strings for decoding from a specified encoding.

**Nested Scopes:**

* **Static scoping:** Nested scopes were made the default, allowing variables to be accessed from enclosing scopes.

**Other Changes:**

* **Unicode filename support:**  Python now handles Unicode filenames on Windows by converting them to MBCS encoded strings.
* **Large file support on Windows:**  Large file support was enabled for Windows.
* **New modules:** Added modules such as `xmlrpclib` (XML-RPC client), `hmac` (HMAC algorithm implementation), and `email` (email message parsing and generation).
* **Enhanced modules:** Improved modules such as `socket` (IPv6 support), `struct` (64-bit integer support), `re` (SRE engine improvements), `smtplib` (TLS and authentication support), `imaplib` (new IMAP extensions support), and `difflib` (human-readable diffs).
* **Interpreter improvements:**  Added C-level profiling and tracing functions, and enhanced the garbage collector API.

These changes made Python a more powerful and flexible language while also addressing some of the historical design flaws.
