Python 2.3 introduced several changes to the core language, including:

* **Generators:** The `yield` keyword is now always a keyword and generators are always enabled.
* **Built-in Functions:** Added `enumerate()` to iterate over a sequence with indices, and `sum()` to sum numeric values in an iterable.
* **Boolean Type:** Added the `bool` type with constants `True` and `False`.
* **Extended Slices:** Added support for the third "step" argument in slicing syntax for built-in sequences (lists, tuples, strings).
* **String Changes:** The `in` operator now supports substring searches in strings. The `strip`, `lstrip`, and `rstrip` methods now accept an optional argument for characters to strip. Added the `zfill` method for padding numeric strings with zeros. Introduced `basestring` as a base type for both 8-bit and Unicode strings.
* **Type Objects:** Type objects are now callable, allowing the creation of new objects.
* **Import Hooks:** Introduced `sys.path_hooks`, `sys.path_importer_cache`, and `sys.meta_path` to extend the import mechanism.
* **`assert` Statement:** The `assert` statement no longer checks the `__debug__` flag.
* **Exceptions:** The `PendingDeprecationWarning` was added to signal features being deprecated. Raising strings as exceptions now triggers `PendingDeprecationWarning`. Using `None` as a variable name results in a `SyntaxWarning`.
* **Method Resolution Order:** Changed to use the C3 algorithm for new-style classes.
* **File Objects:** Files now behave as their own iterators, removing the need for `xreadlines`. Added the `encoding` attribute to indicate the encoding used by the file.
* **Dictionaries:** Added the `pop` method for removing a key-value pair and returning its value. Introduced the `fromkeys` class method to create a dictionary with specific keys and values. The `dict` constructor now accepts keyword arguments.
* **Pymalloc:** The pymalloc object allocator is now enabled by default.
* **C API:** Deprecated the `DL_EXPORT` and `DL_IMPORT` macros. Introduced `PyMODINIT_FUNC` for extension module initialization functions. Consolidated memory allocation functions into two families: raw memory and object memory. 
* **Other:** The interpreter can be compiled without docstrings for built-ins. The `PYTHONINSPECT` environment variable enables interactive mode after program execution. 

These changes introduce new features, improve performance, and bring consistency and clarity to Python's core language.
