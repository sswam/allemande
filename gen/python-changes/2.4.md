Python 2.4 introduces several significant language changes, including:

* **Function decorators:** A new syntax using the "@" symbol allows for more concise function and method decoration, simplifying common tasks like defining class methods or adding functionality.
* **Built-in set and frozenset types:** These new types provide efficient operations for membership testing, duplicate elimination, and mathematical set operations.
* **Generator expressions:** Similar to list comprehensions but create generators that return elements one by one, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets.
* **Unifying long integers and integers:** Certain integer operations that previously triggered warnings now return long integers, simplifying handling of large numbers.
* **Simpler string substitutions:** The `string.Template` class offers a user-friendly syntax for substituting variables into strings, using "$" to indicate placeholders.
* **Reverse iteration:** The `reversed(seq)` function returns an iterator that iterates over a sequence in reverse order.
* **Multi-line imports:** Parentheses can be used to enclose a long list of names in `from module import names` statements, allowing for cleaner code.
* **Improved `dict.update` method:** Accepts various argument forms, making it more versatile.
* **New string methods:**  The `ljust`, `rjust`, and `center` methods now accept a fill character argument, while `rsplit` splits strings from the end.
* **Enhanced `list.sort` method:**  Now accepts `cmp`, `key`, and `reverse` keyword arguments, simplifying sorting operations and ensuring stability.
* **New `sorted` function:** Provides a way to sort any iterable object without modifying the original. 
* **New `os.urandom(n)` function:** Returns a string of random bytes.

These changes aim to enhance code readability, efficiency, and the overall Python developer experience.
