Python 2.6 is a major release that focuses on preparing for the transition to Python 3.0. The release features many new features and syntax from Python 3.0, but remains compatible with existing code. 

The most significant changes include:

* **New features from Python 3.0**: This release backports several new features from Python 3.0, such as the "with" statement, "print" as a function, and advanced string formatting.
* **New modules**: The `multiprocessing` module for parallel processing and the `json` module for working with JavaScript Object Notation are added.
* **New built-in functions**: The `bin` function for converting integers to binary representation is added, and `reduce` is moved to the `functools` module.
* **Changes to the development process**: Python has switched from SourceForge's issue tracker to a customized Roundup installation, and the documentation has been converted from LaTeX to reStructuredText.
* **Deprecations and Removals**: Some outdated modules have been deprecated or removed.
* **C API changes**: Several changes were made to the C API, including the introduction of the new buffer protocol and the implementation of thread-safe file I/O.
* **Optimizations**: Several performance improvements were made, such as rewriting the `warnings` module in C and optimizing function calls that use keyword arguments.
* **Port-specific changes**: Windows 95, 98, ME, and NT4 support was dropped, and the default compiler is now Visual Studio 2008. The Mac OS X version can now be compiled as a 4-way universal build. Several old IRIX-specific modules were deprecated.
