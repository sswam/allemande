Python 2.7 introduced several language changes, including:

* Backported features from Python 3.1: set literals, dictionary and set comprehensions, multiple context managers in a single `with` statement, a new `io` library, ordered dictionaries, the ',' format specifier, memoryview objects, a subset of the `importlib` module, and improved float representation and conversion.
* New `OrderedDict` class in the `collections` module to maintain insertion order.
* New `argparse` module for parsing command-line arguments, replacing `optparse`.
* Dictionary-based configuration for the `logging` module.
* Dictionary views for `dict.keys`, `dict.values`, and `dict.items` using `viewkeys`, `viewvalues`, and `viewitems` respectively.
* The `memoryview` object providing a view of another object's memory content.
* Added `bit_length` method to `int` and `long` types.
* Improved rounding behavior for floating-point conversions.
* Removed implicit coercion for complex numbers.
* Added automatic numbering to `str.format`.
* Added `total_ordering` class decorator to `functools`.
* Added `is_tracked` function to the `gc` module.
* Enhanced the `unittest` module with features like test discovery, better error messages, module/class-level fixtures, and new assertion methods.
* Updated the `ElementTree` library to version 1.3.
* Added a new `importlib.import_module` function.
* Added the `sysconfig` module.
* Included the `tkinter.ttk` module for themed widgets.
* Improved performance in several areas, including garbage collection, long integers, and string operations.
* Added new modules and enhanced existing ones, including `collections`, `ConfigParser`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `ftplib`, `functools`, `gzip`, `hashlib`, `httplib`, `imaplib`, `inspect`, `io`, `itertools`, `json`, `math`, `mailbox`, `multiprocessing`, `os`, `re`, `runpy`, `shutil`, `signal`, `site`, `socket`, `sqlite3`, `ssl`, `subprocess`, `symtable`, `threading`, `unicodedata`, `urlparse`, `weakref`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`, and `zipfile`.
* Added support for IPv6 addresses in several modules.
* Improved support for Windows and Mac OS X.

These changes make Python 2.7 a more powerful, efficient, and secure language.  The changes also make it easier to port code from Python 2.7 to Python 3.
