Python 3.11 brings significant language changes, including:

* **Exception Groups and `except*`:** PEP 654 introduces `ExceptionGroup` and `BaseExceptionGroup` to handle multiple exceptions simultaneously, along with the `except*` syntax.
* **Exception Notes:** PEP 678 allows enriching exceptions with notes using the `BaseException.add_note` method.
* **Fine-grained Error Locations in Tracebacks:** PEP 657 enhances tracebacks to pinpoint the exact expression causing the error, improving error clarity.
* **Variadic Generics:** PEP 646 introduces `TypeVarTuple` for parameterizing generics with an arbitrary number of types, enabling variadic generics for better type checking.
* **Required/NotRequired TypedDict Items:** PEP 655 allows marking individual TypedDict items as required or not-required using `Required` and `NotRequired`.
* **`Self` Type:** PEP 673 introduces the `Self` annotation for annotating methods that return an instance of their class.
* **Arbitrary Literal String Type:** PEP 675 introduces `LiteralString` to annotate function parameters that can accept any literal string type.
* **Data Class Transforms:** PEP 681 introduces `dataclass_transform` for decorating objects that transform classes to have dataclass-like behaviors.
* **Starred Unpacking in For Loops:** Starred unpacking expressions can now be used in for loops.
* **Asynchronous Comprehensions Inside Comprehensions:** Asynchronous comprehensions are allowed inside comprehensions within asynchronous functions.
* **`TypeError` for Missing Context Manager Support:** `TypeError` is now raised when objects lack context manager support in `with` statements.
* **`object.__getstate__` Implementation:** Default implementation added for `__getstate__`, enabling copying and pickling of `slots`-based attributes in certain built-in types.
* **`-P` Command Line Option and `PYTHONSAFEPATH`:** Added to disable automatically prepending potentially unsafe paths to `sys.path`.

Additionally, Python 3.11 brings numerous improvements to standard library modules and other implementation changes, along with significant performance enhancements, particularly for startup and runtime, through optimizations like frozen imports, lazy frames, and inlined function calls. The new "specializing adaptive interpreter" (PEP 659) also contributes to runtime speedups.
