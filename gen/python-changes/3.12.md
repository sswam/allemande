Python 3.12 introduces significant language changes, primarily focused on usability and type hinting:

**New Syntax Features:**

* **Type Parameter Syntax (PEP 695):** A more compact and explicit way to define generic classes and functions using square brackets `[]` and the `type` statement for type aliases.
* **Formalized f-strings (PEP 701):** Lifts restrictions on f-string usage, allowing any valid Python expression, including multi-line expressions, comments, backslashes, and Unicode escape sequences.

**Interpreter Improvements:**

* **Per-Interpreter GIL (PEP 684):** Introduces a unique GIL for each sub-interpreter, enabling better multi-core utilization.
* **Low Impact Monitoring (PEP 669):** Provides a new API for profilers and debuggers to monitor events in CPython with minimal overhead.
* **Improved "Did you mean..." suggestions:** More helpful error messages for `NameError`, `ImportError`, and `SyntaxError` exceptions.

**Typing Enhancements:**

* **TypedDict for **kwargs (PEP 692):** Enables more precise typing of keyword arguments using `TypedDict`.
* **typing.override Decorator (PEP 698):** Helps type checkers identify and prevent errors when overriding methods in superclasses.

**Other Language Changes:**

* The parser now raises `SyntaxError` for source code containing null bytes.
* Variables in comprehension targets can now be used in assignment expressions (`:=`).
* `sum()` now uses Neumaier summation for improved accuracy when summing floats.
* `slice` objects are now hashable, allowing them to be used as dict keys and set items.
* Better error messages for f-strings, providing exact error locations.

**Major Deprecations and Removals:**

* **distutils:** Removed, replaced by `Setuptools`.
* **asynchat, asyncore, imp:** Removed, replaced by `asyncio`.
* **wstr:** Removed from Unicode objects in the C API, reducing `str` object size.
* **Deprecated features in numerous modules:** Emitted warnings for deprecated features with planned removal in future releases.

**Notable Standard Library Improvements:**

* **pathlib:** Added subclassing support and `walk()` method for directory traversal.
* **os:** Several improvements for Windows support, including new functions for enumerating drives and volumes.
* **sqlite3:** Added a command-line interface (`sqlite3-cli`) and support for `autocommit` in connections.
* **asyncio:** Numerous performance enhancements, with some benchmarks showing up to 75% speedup.
* **tokenize:** Faster tokenization due to changes required for f-string parsing.

This summary highlights the most significant language changes and deprecations in Python 3.12. For complete details, refer to the official documentation and relevant PEPs.
