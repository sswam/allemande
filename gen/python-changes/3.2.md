Python 3.2 introduced several language changes:

* **String formatting:**  New capabilities for the `#` format character in `format` and `str.format` for floats, complex, and Decimal. Added `str.format_map` method for arbitrary mapping objects. 
* **Quiet option:** The interpreter can be started with `-q` to suppress copyright and version information.
* **hasattr:** It now only catches `AttributeError` and lets other exceptions pass through.
* **str of floats and complex numbers:** `str` now produces the same output as `repr`.
* **memoryview:** Added `release` method and support for the context management protocol.
* **Deleting names in local namespace:** It is now legal to delete names from the local namespace even if they are free variables in nested blocks.
* **Struct sequence types:**  Subclasses of tuple, making them behave like named tuples.
* **Warnings:**  `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable can be used to control warnings. New `ResourceWarning` category for potential resource consumption issues.
* **range:**  Added `index`, `count`, slicing, and negative indexing support.
* **callable:**  The Py2.x `callable` function was resurrected.
* **Non-ASCII characters in module paths:**  Import mechanism can now load modules from directories with non-ASCII characters in their path names.

These changes improve the flexibility, security, and performance of the Python language.
