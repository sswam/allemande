Python 3.3 brings significant changes to the language, primarily focusing on improvements to the core language features and the standard library. 

**Language Changes:**

* **`yield from` expression:** Introduces a new syntax for generator delegation, allowing generators to delegate parts of their operations to other generators.

* **`bytes` and `bytearray` methods:** The `count()`, `find()`, `rfind()`, `index()`, and `rindex()` methods now accept an integer between 0 and 255 as their first argument. `rjust()`, `ljust()`, and `center()` methods now accept a `bytearray` for the `fill` argument.
* **`list` and `bytearray` methods:** New methods `copy()` and `clear()` are added to `list` and `bytearray`.
