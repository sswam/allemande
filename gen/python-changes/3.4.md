Python 3.4 introduced several significant changes to the language, including:

**New Modules:**

* **asyncio:** A provisional API for asynchronous I/O.
* **ensurepip:** Bootstraps the pip installer.
* **enum:** Supports enumeration types.
* **pathlib:** Offers object-oriented filesystem paths.
* **selectors:** High-level and efficient I/O multiplexing.
* **statistics:** Provides basic numerically stable statistics.
* **tracemalloc:** Traces Python memory allocations.

**Improved Modules:**

* **functools:** Introduced single-dispatch generic functions.
* **pickle:** Added protocol 4 for more efficient serialization.
* **multiprocessing:** Added options to avoid using os.fork on Unix and improved security.
* **email:** Simplified MIME handling with a new submodule and subclass.
* **inspect and pydoc:** Improved introspection for a wider variety of callable objects.
* **ipaddress:** Declared as a stable API.

**Language Changes:**

* **Unicode database:** Updated to UCD version 6.3.
* **min and max:** Added a *default* keyword-only argument.
* **Module objects:** Became weakly referenceable.
* **Module __file__ attributes:** Now always contain absolute paths.
* **UTF-* codecs:** Reject surrogates during encoding and decoding.
* **New codecs:** cp273 (German EBCDIC) and cp1125 (Ukrainian).
* **bytes.join and bytearray.join:** Accept arbitrary buffer objects.
* **int constructor:** Accepts any object with an __index__ method for the *base* argument.
* **Frame objects:** Gain a clear method to clear references to local variables.
* **memoryview:** Registered as a Sequence and supports the reversed builtin.

**Implementation Changes:**

* **PEP 445:** Introduced customizable memory allocators.
* **PEP 442:** Improved object finalization safety, including module global handling.
* **PEP 456:** Standardized the hash algorithm and made it interchangeable.
* **PEP 436:** Introduced Argument Clinic for simplifying C-level function signatures.

**Deprecations:**

* **imp module:** Pending deprecation.
* **formatter module:** Pending deprecation, slated for removal in Python 3.6.
* **MD5 as the default for hmac.new:** Deprecated, will require an explicit digest name in Python 3.6.
* **Netrc class in ftplib:** Deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.5.
* **endtime argument to subprocess.Popen.wait:** Deprecated and likely to be removed in Python 3.5.
* **strict argument of html.parser.HTMLParser:** Deprecated.
* **plistlib functions:** Deprecated in favor of new load, dump, loads, and dumps functions.
* **sysconfig SO key:** Deprecated, replaced by EXT_SUFFIX.
* **U mode in open functions:** Deprecated, replaced by io.TextIOWrapper and its newline argument.
* **pyvenv without-pip option:** Added for compatibility with future changes.

**Removals:**

* **Operating systems:** OS/2, Windows 2000, Windows systems with COMSPEC pointing to command.com, and VMS.
* **Modules:** Misc/TextMate and Misc/vim directories, _gestalt module, and deprecated internal functions.
* **APIs:** PyLoader and PyPycLoader from importlib, strict argument of http.client.HTTPConnection and HTTPSConnection, deprecated urllib.request.Request methods, TYPE_INT64 loading from marshal, positional-only parameters without names in inspect.Signature, non-empty format strings in object.__format__, float values for base in int constructor, stale thread states after os.fork, and unused and deprecated functions.

This summary covers all major changes and deprecations in Python 3.4 related to the language and its API. It does not include detailed information on specific changes or optimizations for individual modules.
