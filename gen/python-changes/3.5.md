Python 3.5 introduced several new language features, including:

* **Async/Await Syntax:**  Coroutine functions are now declared using `async def` syntax. The `await` keyword is used to suspend coroutine execution until the result is available.
* **Matrix Multiplication Operator:** The `@` operator is now available for matrix multiplication.
* **Unpacking Generalizations:**  The `*` and `**` operators can now be used for unpacking in multiple locations within function calls, list, set, and dictionary displays.
* **Bytes Formatting:** The `%` operator is now supported for formatting bytes and bytearrays.

Additionally, there were significant changes to the standard library:

* **Type Hints:**  The `typing` module provides standard definitions and tools for function type annotations.
* **`collections.OrderedDict` is implemented in C:** This makes it significantly faster.
* **New `os.scandir` Function:** This function provides a better and faster way to traverse directories.
* **Improved `functools.lru_cache`:** The `lru_cache` function is now implemented in C, resulting in improved performance.
* **`subprocess.run` Function:** This function provides a streamlined way to run subprocesses.

Other notable changes include:

* **CPython implementation improvements:** This includes a multi-phase process for initializing built-in and extension modules, and the elimination of `.pyo` files.
* **Security improvements:** SSLv3 is now disabled by default.
* **Windows improvements:** A new installer has replaced the old MSI, and Windows builds now use Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0.
* **Language improvements:** This includes new error handlers, support for circular imports involving relative imports, and writable property docstrings.

These changes represent significant improvements to the Python language and standard library, enhancing its functionality, performance, and security.
