Python 3.6 introduces several new language features:

- **Formatted string literals (f-strings):** These provide a more concise and readable way to format strings using expressions. 
- **Underscores in numeric literals:** Allows underscores to improve the readability of large numbers.
- **Syntax for variable annotations:** Introduces a new syntax for annotating the types of variables, making it easier for tools to understand and analyze code.
- **Asynchronous generators:**  Enables the use of `await` and `yield` within the same function, allowing for more efficient asynchronous operations.
- **Asynchronous comprehensions:** Allows using `async for` and `await` within list, set, dict comprehensions and generator expressions, streamlining asynchronous code.

The `dict` type has been reimplemented for improved memory efficiency.

The descriptor protocol has been enhanced to include the `__set_name__` method, allowing descriptors to know their attribute names.

A new file system path protocol has been implemented to support path-like objects, simplifying the use of file system paths.

The order of attributes in class definitions and keyword arguments in function calls is now preserved.

A new `secrets` module has been added for generating cryptographically strong pseudo-random values.

The Windows console and filesystem encodings have been changed to UTF-8, improving support for Unicode characters. 

The standard library has seen many improvements across modules, including asyncio, datetime, typing, and tracemalloc. 

Several performance optimizations have been made throughout the interpreter and standard library. 

Changes to the C API include the addition of new functions for error handling, memory allocation, and file system path conversion.

Various build options have been changed, and some deprecated features have been removed.
