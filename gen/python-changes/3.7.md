Python 3.7 introduces several significant language changes:

- **Postponed Evaluation of Annotations:** Type annotations are now evaluated at runtime, enabling forward references and improving startup time.
- **Reserved Keywords:** `async` and `await` are now reserved keywords.
- **Built-in `breakpoint()`:** A new built-in function provides a consistent way to enter the debugger.
- **Module `__getattr__` and `__dir__`:** Modules can now customize attribute access using these methods.
- **`dict` Order Preservation:** The insertion order of dictionary items is now officially part of the language spec.
- **Function Arguments:** Functions can now accept and define more than 255 arguments/parameters.
- **`bytes.fromhex` and `bytearray.fromhex`:** These methods now ignore all ASCII whitespace, not just spaces.
- **`str.isascii`:** A new method is added to check if a string contains only ASCII characters.
- **`ImportError` Message:** The message for failed `from ... import ...` statements now includes the module name and file path.
- **Circular Imports:** Circular imports involving absolute imports and submodule bindings are now supported.
- **`object.__format__`:** The behavior of `object.__format__(x, '')` is changed to be equivalent to `str(x)`.
- **`traceback.tb_next` Writability:** The `traceback.tb_next` attribute is now writable for better dynamic stack trace support.
- **`sys.path[0]` Expansion:** When using the `-m` switch, `sys.path[0]` is eagerly expanded to the full path.
- **`-X importtime` Option:** A new option is added to show import timing information. 
- **`await` Expressions in F-Strings:** `await` expressions are now allowed within f-strings.

These changes enhance the language's capabilities, improve performance, and address potential security vulnerabilities.
