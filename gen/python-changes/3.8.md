Python 3.8 introduces significant language changes, including:

* **Assignment Expressions:** A new syntax `:=` assigns values to variables within larger expressions, improving code readability.
* **Positional-Only Parameters:** The `/` syntax marks function parameters that must be specified positionally, preventing keyword arguments.
* **Parallel Filesystem Cache:**  The `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` environment variable configures the bytecode cache to use a separate filesystem tree, improving performance.
* **F-string Enhancements:** F-strings gain the `=` specifier to display the expression and its evaluated result.
* **PEP 578: Runtime Audit Hooks:** Audit and verified open hooks enable applications and frameworks to monitor code execution and file access.
* **PEP 587: Python Initialization Configuration:** This PEP introduces a C API for finer-grained control over Python initialization, allowing better error reporting.
* **PEP 590: Vectorcall:** This protocol optimizes calling conventions for statically typed callable objects.
* **Pickle Protocol 5:**  The `pickle` module adds support for out-of-band data buffers, enhancing efficiency in data transfer.
* **Generalized Iterable Unpacking:**  Unpacking in `yield` and `return` statements no longer requires parentheses, improving consistency with assignment syntax.
* **`reversed` for Dicts and Dictviews:**  `reversed` now works with dicts and dictviews, iterating them in reverse insertion order.
* **`math` Module Enhancements:**  New functions include `dist`, `prod`, `perm`, `comb`, `isqrt`, and a multi-dimensional `hypot`.
* **`statistics` Module Improvements:**  New functions include `fmean`, `geometric_mean`, `multimode`, and `quantiles`.
* **`typing` Module Enhancements:**  Introduces `TypedDict` for per-key type annotations, `Literal` for defining constrained values, `Final` for marking variables, functions, and classes as immutable, and `Protocol` for defining abstract base classes.
* **`asyncio` Enhancements:**  `asyncio.run` for simplifying event loop management, a native async REPL, and improved support for IPv6 and UDP.
* **Improved `curses` Module:**  The `ncurses_version` attribute provides structured version information for the ncurses library.
* **`unittest` Improvements:**  `AsyncMock` for asynchronous mocking, `IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` for testing coroutines, and improved mock assertion reporting.
* **`xml.etree.ElementTree` Enhancements:**  Supports wildcard searches in `.find*()` methods and adds the `canonicalize` function for C14N 2.0.

Many modules have received significant performance improvements, including `subprocess`, `shutil`, `pickle`, `operator`, `collections.namedtuple`, `list`, and built-in functions and methods.  Additionally, there are several deprecated features and API changes.  Be sure to review the documentation for these changes to ensure your code remains compatible with Python 3.8.
