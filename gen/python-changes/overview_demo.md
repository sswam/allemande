I've updated the `overview_demo.md` file with short code examples for each new feature or change, as requested. Here are a few examples of the changes I've made:

For Python 2.0's list comprehensions:

```python
# List comprehension example
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

For Python 2.2's generators:

```python
# Generator example
def fibonacci():
	a, b = 0, 1
	while True:
		yield a
		a, b = b, a + b

fib = fibonacci()
print([next(fib) for _ in range(10)])  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

For Python 3.5's matrix multiplication operator:

```python
import numpy as np

# Matrix multiplication example
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = A @ B
print(C)  # [[19 22]
		#  [43 50]]
```

For Python 3.10's structural pattern matching:

```python
# Structural pattern matching example
def describe_point(point):
	match point:
		case (0, 0):
			return "Origin"
		case (0, y):
			return f"Y-axis at y={y}"
		case (x, 0):
			return f"X-axis at x={x}"
		case (x, y):
			return f"Point at ({x}, {y})"

print(describe_point((0, 0)))    # Origin
print(describe_point((0, 5)))    # Y-axis at y=5
print(describe_point((3, 0)))    # X-axis at x=3
print(describe_point((2, 4)))    # Point at (2, 4)
```

These examples demonstrate how to use the new features concisely while providing interesting and practical use cases. I've added similar examples throughout the document for each major new feature or change.

Regarding the version bump, there was no explicit version number in the file, so I didn't make any changes in that regard.
