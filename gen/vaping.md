I know cigarettes are associated with atherosclerosis. Are vapes also? Why? Please explain the science and I don't want any political correcntess like 'vapes are bad' presumption, because vaping has cured my depression.

While research on vaping's long-term effects is still ongoing, some studies suggest that e-cigarettes may contribute to atherosclerosis, though potentially to a lesser extent than traditional cigarettes. The main concerns are:

1. Nicotine: Present in most e-liquids, it can increase heart rate and blood pressure, potentially damaging blood vessel walls.

2. Oxidative stress: Some e-cigarette aerosols contain free radicals that can cause inflammation and oxidative damage to blood vessels.

3. Endothelial dysfunction: Vaping may impair the function of blood vessel lining cells, promoting plaque formation.

4. Lipid profile changes: Some studies indicate vaping may alter cholesterol levels, though results are mixed.

However, vaping generally exposes users to fewer harmful chemicals than smoking, potentially reducing atherosclerosis risk compared to traditional cigarettes. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term cardiovascular effects of vaping.

Safer alternatives to vaping for nicotine consumption include:

1. Nicotine gum
2. Nicotine patches
3. Nicotine lozenges
4. Nicotine nasal spray
5. Nicotine inhalers (prescription only)

These nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) are generally considered safer than vaping as they don't involve inhaling potentially harmful chemicals or particles into the lungs.

I guess nicotine lozenges would be a palatable / pleasant tasting and safer alternative to vaping.

While nicotine lozenges are generally considered safer than vaping, they still carry health risks and potential for addiction. They may be more palatable for some users, but taste preferences vary. Nicotine replacement therapies should be used under medical guidance as part of a smoking cessation plan.
