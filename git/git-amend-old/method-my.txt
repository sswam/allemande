It needs to be entirely automatic, aside from editing the commit message for
the amended commit (can also be provided as an option, or left unchanged via an
option), or resolving conflicts. It should behave exactly like
`git commit --amend`, but for a previous commit.

I'm thinking:

  1. user stashes irrelevant files and changes (the script does not do this)
  2. user stages changes to be added to the commit
  3. User runs the script specifying the commit to be amended and an
     optional message.
  4. script stashes changes.
  5. script runs rebase from the commit BEFORE the selected commit (foo~1),
     using a sed command in EDITOR to marks that we need the edit or amend the commit.
  6. script pops changes from the stash, these will be added to the commit
. 7. if conflicts, script shows a warning on steerr and opens an interactive shell for user to fix them
  8. script runs rebase --continue, with the --message if given (otherwise git will open an editor)
  9. should be done

The harder part is the sed command for the editor.
