# Important Notes to AI

Simplicity is more important than correctness.

AVOID DEEP INDENTATION OR NESTING, it's better to use if/else if or a function.
This is the number one rule! If needed, we can use variables to avoid repeating
parts of conditions. Test negative or short cases first, and use continue,
break, or return to avoid deep nesting.

Do not remove comments, logging or blank lines, especially not TODO, FIXME,
XXX. Do not remove ANYTHING unnecessarily. If you are 1000% sure something is
wrong, comment it out rather than removing it.

Never handle something that should be an error as a warning.

Stdout is only for normal output. Use stderr for info, warning or error
messages.

The original coder was probably not an idiot. Be careful when "fixing"
things. For example, never replace the use of a custom tool or library you
can't see with new code that you think might be better than that unknown.

Follow the principles from The Practice of Programming by Kernighan and Pike,
e.g. "simplicity, clarity, generality". As Linus advises, "Good taste" in
programming often means preferring clear, simple solutions over clever ones.

Care about security and correctness, e.g. escaping html entities, SQL values...

In loops needing final handling, prefer io.EOF checks, sentinel values, or functions over duplicated code; use append() for combining slices if needed
