Kennedy's fame now gone,
His legacy still endures,
History remembers.
Demonstrably true,
Proof stands firm, unshakeable,
All doubts cast aside.
Whispers of green leaves,
Monolithic trees converse,
Forest life flourished.
A gentle saunter,
Through a world that rushes by,
Peaceful serenity.
Nurturing and kind,
A mother's love never fades,
Heart full, always giving.
Unseen patterns dance,
Shuffled into harmony,
Chaos finds its chance.
Cradle of strong arms
Whispers of love in the night
Life blooms tenderly
Demonstrably clear,
Evidence stands through the mist,
Truth whispers, we hear.
Fragments converge here,
Through the lens, light softly bends,
Silent clarity.
In the sun's warm hug,
Lazy footsteps sauntering,
Nature whispers peace.
Iron gate descends,
Castle's guarded entrance sealed,
Portcullis prevails.
Rocks rise from the ground,
Carved by the winds of ages,
Proud outcrop stands tall.
Cards shuffled neatly,
Awaiting their next chapter.
Luck lies in the deal.
Here is a haiku on the topic of 'demonstrably':

Evidence mounts high,
Truth proven without question,
Demonstrably so.
Camelot's bright sun,
Kennedy dream in the wind,
Hope endures beyond.
Stones piercing the earth,
Outcrop whispers ancient tales,
Time's relentless march.
Tiny glass window
Captures beauty in focus
Life through a lens gleams
Here is a haiku on the topic of 'lens':

Glass form, bending light,
Focusing on details unseen,
Revealing new worlds.
Tall trees reach the sky,
Nature's beauty captured here,
Peace in forestry.
Current themes flow swift
Rivers of discourse streaming
Topical dance drifts
Portcullis bars stay low,
An obstacle unyielding,
Castle gates secure.
Nature's remedies,
Topical ointments and creams,
Healing from within.
