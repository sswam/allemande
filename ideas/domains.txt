hobby, travel, fitness, language, gaming, culture, business, pet, food, parent, faith, literature, fashion, eco, charity, LGBTQ+, local, DIY, tech, film.

Could have lots of separate domains but we can use rooms for that. Mainly we would need different domains only for very different purposes / safety reasons.
