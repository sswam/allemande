## Benefits of Implementing Other Changes:

2. **Error Handling:** - Adding error handling would improve the script's
   resilience. For instance, it can handle cases where malformed markdown causes
   issues, providing user-friendly error messages instead of Python tracebacks.

4. **Code Block Pattern:** - Updating `code_block_pattern` to handle cases
   like indented code blocks in Markdown would make the script more flexible and
   capable of processing a wider range of Markdown formats correctly.

   - For example, Markdown specifications sometimes allow code blocks to be
   indented by four spaces or a tab. Adjusting the pattern to accommodate
   these scenarios ensures that all valid Markdown code blocks are detected
   and processed.

By implementing error handling and making the code block pattern more robust,
the script's utility and performance in real-world applications would be
significantly enhanced.


```python
def test_extract_code_with_indented_code_blocks():
    """
    Tests the function with indented code blocks in Markdown.
    The expected output should correctly capture and return the code block without the added indentation.
    """
    markdown = qi("""
        Here is some indented code:

            def indented_function():
                print('This is indented code')
    """)
    # Since indented code blocks are not surrounded by ``` in this case, they should be treated as regular text
    expected = qi("""
        # Here is some indented code:
        # def indented_function():
        #     print('This is indented code')
    """)
    assert extract_code_from_markdown(markdown, comment_prefix="#") == expected
```
