Thank you for sharing this code! It's an impressive and comprehensive wrapper for various language model APIs. The modular approach and support for multiple vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Google) is excellent. I appreciate the attention to detail in handling different model options, retries, and token counting. Here's some friendly praise followed by suggestions for improvement:

Praise:
- The code is well-structured and organized, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- Excellent use of async programming for efficient API calls.
- Great error handling and retry mechanisms.
- The flexibility to work with different models and vendors is very useful.
- Good documentation and helpful comments throughout the code.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Modularization: Consider splitting the code into multiple files for better organization. For example:
	- models.py: Define MODELS and related functions
	- api_clients.py: Implement vendor-specific API clients
	- utils.py: Helper functions like split_message_line, lines_to_messages, etc.
	- main.py: Main entry point and CLI commands

2. Configuration: Move configuration settings (like LOGDIR, RETRIES, etc.) to a separate config.py file.

3. Type hinting: Add more type hints to improve code readability and catch potential errors.

4. Error handling: Create custom exceptions for specific error cases to make error handling more robust.

5. Testing: Add unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for API calls.

6. Logging: Implement a more robust logging system with different log levels for debugging and production use.

7. API abstraction: Create a common interface for all API clients to further simplify the main code.

8. Dependency management: Use a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file to manage dependencies.

9. Documentation: Consider using a tool like Sphinx to generate comprehensive documentation.

10. Async consistency: Make all functions async for consistency, or provide both sync and async versions.

These suggestions aim to make your already impressive code even more modular, maintainable, and robust. Great work on creating this versatile LLM wrapper!
