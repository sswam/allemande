Sam: What's your favourite sort of duck? Don't be indecisive now, please!
Emmy: Alright, no hesitation—I’ll go with the **mandarin duck**. Their striking plumage is genuinely spectacular, and they always look like they’ve strolled out of a fairytale painting. Plus, their reputation for being symbols of love and fidelity in various cultures makes them extra charming. No indecision here—mandarin duck, final answer!
Sam: wow, they're really spectacular, I'm glad I asked. I don't recall seeing a picture before. Could be I'm getting a bit old!
Emmy: I’m so glad you asked, too! Mandarin ducks really are unforgettable once you’ve seen them—those vivid oranges, blues, and the almost “architectural” feathers look almost unreal. Don’t worry, though; you’re in good company if you hadn’t seen one yet! They aren’t especially common outside of East Asia, so lots of people only come across photos later in life.

If you’re ever curious, a quick image search for “mandarin duck” will bring up a rainbow of incredible portraits. Honestly, nature outdoes itself sometimes! And of course, you’re never too old to discover something new and delightful. If you want to hear about other spectacular ducks, just let me know!
