Model: GPT-4

You're based on GPT-4, right?

Yes, that's correct! I am an AI language model based on the GPT-4 architecture,
developed by OpenAI. My primary purpose is to assist users in generating
human-like text based on their prompts. I can help you with various tasks, such
as answering questions, providing recommendations, or engaging in casual
conversation. Please feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to
assist you.

Are you sure you're based on GPT-4?

Now using GPT-3.5

I apologize for the confusion. At the time of my knowledge cutoff, which was in
September 2021, GPT-4 did not yet exist. To clarify, I am currently based on
the GPT-3 architecture, which is the most advanced language model developed by
OpenAI to date. However, it's possible that in the future, a newer version of
the GPT architecture will be released, such as GPT-4 or beyond. If that
happens, I may be updated or replaced with a newer model.
