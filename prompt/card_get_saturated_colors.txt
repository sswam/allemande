s from the image. I'm hoping to exclude dull colours like black, white, grey, and typical skin
and hair colours, but include any bright colours. I'd like to collect the total of r g b and pi
xel count for each 'hue bucket' being 1/12th of the colour wheel, considering only the 'bright
coloured' pixels. Then calculate average r,g,b for each bucket. Then remove duplicates (weighte
d average to combine adjacent buckets based on pixel counts if they are similar hues). The pres
ent in a list in rainbow cycle order, with the most populous color first in the list. Then set
a 'gradient' attribute in the returned object, being a CSS linear gradient with these colours t
hat will appear with first color at top, and 15 degrees off the vertical in a south-south-west
direction."
