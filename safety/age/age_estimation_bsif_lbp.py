# Here's a script that uses the facial age estimation method described in the paper "Facial Age Estimation using BSIF and LBP" to estimate the age of individuals in images. The script expects image paths on stdin, one per line, and outputs detected information on stdout in TSV format, with the filename in the right-most column.

# **Note**: The script uses OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for feature extraction and age estimation. The `extract_bsif_lbp_features` function extracts BSIF and LBP features from the input image, and the `estimate_age` function uses a pre-trained random forest regressor to estimate the age based on the extracted features. The `process_images` function processes images from stdin and outputs the estimated ages to stdout in TSV format.
#
# **Important**: The script assumes that the UTKFace dataset is used to train the random forest regressor. You'll need to modify the script to use your own dataset or pre-trained model. Additionally, the script uses a simple random forest regressor, which may not provide the best results. You may want to experiment with more advanced machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
