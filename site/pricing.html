<p><strong>Prefer a one-time payment?</strong> Enjoy permanent access to
Ally Chat with a 25-month equivalent base price - $250 for individuals
and $1,250 for business/family (10 users) accounts. This includes
ongoing access to all of our services, including Open AI’s models, for
as long as both companies exist.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Refunds and Money-Back Guarantee</strong>: If you
use Ally Chat minimally during any calendar month, we offer a refund for
that month’s access fee. We also provide a six-month money-back
guarantee for both subscriptions and permanent purchases. Try Ally Chat
for six months, and if you’re not satisfied, we’ll refund your
payment.</p>
<p><strong>Transparent Usage</strong>: Our plans allow for any
reasonable use of our AI models, including GPT-4. We also provide
transparent retries, ensuring your messages reach their destination even
when an upstream service is overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Perks</strong>: If you contribute to our company
or projects, at our discretion we may offer you a period of free access
as a gesture of our gratitude. Feel free to reach out to us for more
information.</p>
