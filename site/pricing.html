<h1 class="title">Introducing Ally Chat Pricing Plans</h1>
</header>
<p>We are excited to present our Ally Chat pricing plans, designed to
cater to individual users, small businesses, and families alike,
including a Free Plan to get you started. To help you decide on the
right plan for you, we offer a free 1-month trial with no credit card
required for the Individual and Business / Family plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Plan: $0 / month (access to all models except GPT-4)</li>
<li>Individual Plan: $10 / month</li>
<li>Pro / Family Plan (10 users): $50 / month (50% discount per user
compared to individual plans)</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore Ally Chat’s incredible features, including superior user
interface with access to GPT-4 and ChatGPT 3.5 in the paid plans, valued
at over $20/month, as well as numerous other cutting-edge features.
Plus, access our “pro” user-interface designed for corporate use, coming
soon at no extra cost.</p>
<p>For individuals or businesses that require enhanced privacy or
on-site installations, Ally Chat Pro can be embedded in your own
website, with pricing available on application. This allows for meeting
specific privacy requirements while still enjoying the benefits of our
AI chat solutions.</p>
<p>As a member of Ally Chat, all updates, products, services, and
features will be available to you without additional charges. Ally Chat
also offers highly discounted consulting services for members. Please
note that business plans and lifetime members must pay for the GPT-4
costs if they exceed the subscription costs.</p>

<p><strong>Prefer a one-time payment?</strong> Enjoy lifetime access to
Ally Chat with a 25-month equivalent base price - $250 for individuals
and $1,250 for pro / family (10 users) accounts. This includes ongoing
access to all of our services, including Open AI’s models, for as long
as both companies exist.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Refunds and Money-Back Guarantee</strong>: If you
use Ally Chat minimally during any calendar month, we offer a refund for
that month’s access fee. We also provide a six-month money-back
guarantee for both subscriptions and lifetime purchases. Try Ally Chat
for six months, and if you’re not satisfied, we’ll refund your
payment.</p>
<p><strong>Transparent Usage</strong>: Our plans allow for any
reasonable use of our AI models, including GPT-4 for paid plans. We also
provide transparent retries, ensuring your messages reach their
destination even when an upstream service is overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Perks</strong>: If you contribute to our company
or projects, at our discretion we may offer you a period of free access
as a gesture of our gratitude. Feel free to reach out to us for more
information.</p>
