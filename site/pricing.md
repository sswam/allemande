We also provide a six-month money-back guarantee for both subscriptions and permanent purchases. Try Ally Chat for six months, and if you're not satisfied, we'll refund your payment.

**Transparent Usage**: Our plans allow for any reasonable use of our AI models, including GPT-4. We also provide transparent retries, ensuring your messages reach their destination even when an upstream service is overwhelmed.

**Additional Perks**: If you contribute to our company or projects, at our discretion we may offer you a period of free access as a gesture of our gratitude. Feel free to reach out to us for more information.
