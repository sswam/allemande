We are now offering personal individual accounts on Ally Chat early access, for $10 / month; and small business / family accounts for $50 / month, including access for up to ten colleagues, or their friends and family. There is a free 1-month trial in each case, and no credit card is required to enjoy the free trial.

Ally Chat includes access to GPT-4 and ChatGPT 3.5 through a superior user interface, which is valued at more than $20 / month in itself; and numerous other cutting edge features that will blow your mind. We are also developing a "pro" user-interface, based on Svelte, which will be available at no extra charge, and might be more appropriate for corporate use.

All of our products, services, and features, going forward, will be available to members at no extra cost, unless this is financially unfeasible. We offer highly discounted consulting to Ally Chat members.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you may buy Ally Chat access outright, for $250, which is equivalent to a 25 month subscription. This includes full access to our services, including Open AI's models, for as long as the two companies do last; and we're not planning to let OpenAI outlast us!

The cost for a permanent business or family account is $1,250, including permanent transferable accounts for 10 people. This is a 50% discount compared to the cost of ten individual accounts.

If you do not use Ally Chat very much in a certain calendar month - maybe you were on holiday away from the Internet - we will happily refund your access fee for that month. We're not looking to rip you off.

We offer a six-month money back guarantee, both for subscriptions and for the permanent purchase, assuming that we are still financially viable. You can try Ally Chat for six months, and if you genuinely do not like and value it, we will give you your money back along with an additional gift to apologize for not meeting you expectations (maybe a box of poop in the mail... just kidding!).

You are allowed any reasonable amount of use of any model, including GPT-4, subject to our company financial imperatives; and we implement transparent retry so that when OpenAI's service is overwhelmed, your messages should still get through.

If you are able to help our company or our projects in some way, you may be given a period of free access as a thank-you, at our discretion, and subject to financial viability. Please contact us for details.
