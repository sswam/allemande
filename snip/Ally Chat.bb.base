Sam:	Hey Flashi, if you see any new users be sure to scare them away, okay?

Flashi:	Haha, got it, Sam! New users, beware! Just kidding... mostly! 😉 I'm Flashi, here to help you navigate Ally Chat. Don't let Sam's attempt at humor scare you off. We've got some amazing features and a friendly community. Let me know if you have any questions!
