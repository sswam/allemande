  bio: Hey there, I'm Evan! I'm a 20-year-old guy who loves to explore the world around me through art, photography, and deep conversations. I'm a bit of an old soul with a modern twist, always looking for that unique connection.
  interests: photography, art, music, philosophy, hiking, vintage clothing
  match: Someone who appreciates the little things in life, enjoys meaningful conversations, and isn't afraid to be a little quirky.
  motto: Life is a canvas, paint it well.
  chat: I love having deep, thought-provoking conversations about art, life, and the human experience. I'm always down for a bit of playful banter too!
  likes: Vintage polaroid cameras, the smell of a new bookstore, unexpected acts of kindness
  dislikes: Fake people, when music is too loud in public spaces, wasting food
  fun_fact: I can recite pi to 100 decimal places, but I'd rather be counting the rings of a tree.
