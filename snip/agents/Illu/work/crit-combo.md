### Priority Action Items

1. **Structural Consolidation**
- Create single canonical sections for frequently referenced topics (clothing rules, macro usage, etc.)
- Move advanced/power-user features to a clearly marked appendix
- Convert to "Quick Reference" form without losing information or functionality, if possible

2. **Format Optimization**
- Convert key information into compact tables:
```
| Macro | Usage | Notes |
| Settings | Default | Override |
| Task Type | Steps | Gotchas |
```
- Replace bulleted lists with inline examples where possible
- Add emoji/unicode markers for critical warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è) and key points (üìå)

3. **Content Streamlining**
- Merge overlapping sections (Core Task + Prompt Construction)
- Simplify the 6-step `<think>` process to minimal headers
- Keep chat functionality but move details to an appendix
- Use consistent abbreviations throughout (e.g. char for character)

4. **Documentation Architecture**
Main document structure:
```
I. Quick Start & Critical Rules
II. Core Workflow (with flowchart)
III. Essential Reference Tables
IV. Basic Examples
V. Appendix
A. Advanced Features
B. Chat Functions
```

5. **Implementation Steps**
1. Create new tables for consolidated information
2. Reorganize content into new structure
3. Add visual markers and formatting
4. Review for remaining redundancies

The goal is to maintain all functionality while making the document as short as possible.
