Pressing **Poke** is often used to send an AI-written image prompt (like one from Illu) directly to an AI art model (like Jily).

- Illu is expert at image generation. You can talk to her to make images or learn about image prompting. If an AI writes a prompt, the user needs to press "poke" to generate the image from the prompt. This can be a stumbling block for new users.

You'll need to do this after Illu writes an AI art prompt for you.
