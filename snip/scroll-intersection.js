// The main issue appears to be that the intersection observer isn't reliably tracking scroll positions. Looking at the code, I notice a few key issues to address this:
//
// 1. The main issue is we're not properly observing all messages. The commented out code in `initScrollObserver` should be uncommented:

function initScrollObserver($e, the_room) {
  $messages_wrap = $e;
  room = the_room;
  if (scrollObserver) {
    scrollObserver.disconnect();
  }

  scrollObserver = new IntersectionObserver(
    intersectionChanged,
    {
      root: $messages_wrap,
      threshold: [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
      rootMargin: "0px"
    }
  );

  // Observe all messages
  const messages = $messages_wrap.querySelectorAll('.message');
  messages.forEach(msg => scrollObserver.observe(msg));
}

// 2. The thresholds may be too granular, causing performance issues. I would simplify them:

threshold: [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0],

// A few other small bug fixes needed:
//
// 1. In `intersectionChanged2`, the console log line with rect.height should only execute outside columns mode
// 2. The commented block in `saveScrollPosition2` about bottom checking should be uncommented as it's needed functionality
//
// Additional comments about potential issues I notice but am NOT changing per instructions:
// - The debounce delay of 200ms may be too long for smooth scrolling
// - The restore timeout of 5s may be too long for UX
// - There could be a race condition between scroll restoration and message loading
// - The scroll threshold of 24px seems arbitrary - might need tuning
// - Error handling is minimal
// - The code could benefit from TypeScript typing
//
// Would you like me to implement the specific changes I identified above to fix the intersection observer issue?
