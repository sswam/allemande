I apologise for the long delay!

Thanks for your interest in Ally Chat!  r/AllyChat  r/AllyChatX (NSFW)

I'm Sam, the main developer at Allemande AI, from Melbourne Australia.

The following questions are optional!

2. How do you want to use AI?  Your ideal AI chat partner?  male/female/non-binary/any?
3. Please introduce yourself. Do you prefer to chat in another language?
4. Your dream feature (think big!), and biggest annoyance with other AI apps?
5. Any personal goals or problems you can share? We can help you with them in the app!

Cool, I hope you like it!

The app is unusual and has many hidden features! PLEASE join group chats, and we can show you how to make the most of it!

You can message our community leaders - Sam, Ganja, and Dave - for support and a friendly chat. At any time likely a few of us will be online in the group chats, or you can try your luck with AI helpers like Aidi, Assi, Loni, Lori, Ally, etc.

If you're interested to support after a while, there's lots of different ways to do that, not all about money!
