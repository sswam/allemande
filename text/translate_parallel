process "Please provide a parallel translation of the text, word by word or very short phrases, in a markdown table with the source language on the left, then $target on the right. Keep the original word order, so the $target might not appear in the usual word order. Where a word translates to a phrase, or a phrase to a word, put the whole phrase on one line. Where a word does not appear in one language, leave that side blank. Finally, under the table provide the translation into $target with sensible word order so that the meaning is clear. Please also add a pronunciation column between the other two columns if the source language does not use the latin alphabet, with a phonetic transliteration. If you add any headings please use markdown formatting like `## heading`. Please exactly preserve any paragraphing and such from the source the final translation. Thanks for being awesome!"
