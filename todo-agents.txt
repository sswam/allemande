TODO:
- remote agents, add key as name
- remote models: need to limit context by tokens not messages
- move config.sh and agents to ~/my/allemande/$hostname and symlink back
- could keep agents under rooms?  makes sense...

- conductor for multi addressing like @Emmy and @Claude, do you like the pictures?
	- implemented, but not working yet, not sure why...
	- issue, this syntax will provoke the AI's to also use @ notation. We could possibly remove it when converting to HTML, or convert them to links.
