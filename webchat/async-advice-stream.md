I am getting errors like these from my async app. Can you describe the problem / cause, and different approaches to solve it, in detail? I understand basics of async programming but not so good with the error handling side of it.

ERROR:asyncio:Task was destroyed but it is pending!
task: <Task pending name='Task-2182' coro=<<async_generator_asend without __name__>()> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[Task.task_wakeup()]>>
ERROR:asyncio:Task exception was never retrieved
future: <Task finished name='Task-2188' coro=<<async_generator_athrow without __name__>()> exception=RuntimeError('aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running')>
RuntimeError: aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running

These errors typically occur when async tasks or generators are not properly awaited, closed, or handled when they're being destroyed. Let's break down the issues and solutions:

1. "Task was destroyed but it is pending":
This means a Task was garbage collected while still running.

```python
# Problematic code
async def my_coroutine():
    await some_long_operation()

# Creating task without awaiting it
asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())  # Task created but not stored or awaited
```

Solutions:

A. Store and await the task:
```python
async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
    await task
```

B. Use task groups (Python 3.11+):
```python
async def main():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        tg.create_task(my_coroutine())
```

C. Keep track of tasks:
```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._tasks = set()

    def create_task(self, coro):
        task = asyncio.create_task(coro)
        self._tasks.add(task)
        task.add_done_callback(self._tasks.discard)
        return task

task_manager = TaskManager()
```

2. "Task exception was never retrieved":
This happens when a task raises an exception but no one awaits it to handle the exception.

Solutions:

A. Add exception handling:
```python
async def main():
    try:
        task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
        await task
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Task failed: {e}")
```

B. Add done callbacks:
```python
def handle_exception(task):
    try:
        task.result()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Task failed: {e}")

task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
task.add_done_callback(handle_exception)
```

3. "aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running":
This occurs when trying to close an async generator that's already running.

```python
# Problematic code
async def generator():
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield "value"

# Multiple concurrent uses of the same generator
gen = generator()
```

Solutions:

A. Use separate generator instances:
```python
async def main():
    gen1 = generator()
    gen2 = generator()
    # Use separate instances
```

B. Proper cleanup with async context managers:
```python
class AsyncGen:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.gen = generator()
        return self.gen

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        await self.gen.aclose()

async def main():
    async with AsyncGen() as gen:
        async for value in gen:
            # use value
```

4. General Best Practices:

A. Use asyncio.gather for multiple tasks:
```python
async def main():
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        task1(), 
        task2(),
        return_exceptions=True  # Prevents exceptions from propagating
    )
```

B. Implement proper cleanup:
```python
async def main():
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(10):  # Python 3.11+
            await some_operation()
    except TimeoutError:
        # Handle timeout
    finally:
        # Cleanup code
```

C. Use structured concurrency (Python 3.11+):
```python
async def main():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        task1 = tg.create_task(operation1())
        task2 = tg.create_task(operation2())
        # All tasks will be properly awaited and cleaned up
```

D. Implement proper cancellation handling:
```python
async def cancelable_operation():
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        # Cleanup
        raise  # Re-raise to propagate cancellation

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancelable_operation())
    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        task.cancel()
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Task was cancelled")
```

5. Debugging Tools:

A. Enable debug mode:
```python
import asyncio
asyncio.get_event_loop().set_debug(True)
```

B. Use warnings:
```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("always", category=RuntimeWarning)
```

These solutions should help you handle most async-related errors. The key is to:
- Always await your tasks
- Handle exceptions properly
- Implement proper cleanup
- Use structured concurrency where possible
- Keep track of your tasks
- Implement proper cancellation handling
