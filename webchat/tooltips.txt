query "I want some CSS and JS code to show 'title' tooltips on mobile, if the user long-taps or holds on an element having a 'title', and then if they 'drag about' it should show the tooptips for whatever they are hovering over immediately. Ideally support markup in the tooltips if the title begins with 'html:'. Show 'offset_y' pixels above unless at the top, then 'offset_y' pixels below. Please ensure the whole tooltip is visible not going off-screen. Don't prevent any other default action or event from long hold. We can do similar on desktop with hover for better styling, i.e. temporarily disable the title attr while hovering, wait a little, then show the hint and continue showing other hints instantly until no longer hovering on an element with title for a little while. If there is some library that does this very well and with customisable styling maybe we could use that."
