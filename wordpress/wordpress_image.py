This modified script allows uploading both normal image and its @2K version in one go. The `upload_image` function now takes two file paths, one for the normal image and another for the @2K image. To use the new version of the script, pass both `-n` and `-k` options with the respective file paths:

```sh
python wp_images.py upload_image -n /path/to/normal/image.jpg -k /path/to/2k/image.jpg
```
